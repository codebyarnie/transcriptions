course by deep charts. My name is Andrea
and I will take you with this course
from zero to understanding everything
you need to know about orderflow,
understanding how to read the auction,
understand how all of the market
mechanics work and most of the trading
tools. So, I'm very excited to have you
here. Welcome.
So what you'll learn in this course is
first what is orderflow and why you
should even use it in the first place.
Uh understanding futures contracts
everything you need to know about
futures contracts.
How the double auction works. The types
of order flows and data feeds. The main
matching algorithms that exist
the time and sales tools and how to read
it.
Then we're going to get a look to the
depth of market
and let's say these are the two main
orderflow tools. You know they they are
the basic they are the raw version the
rawest version of orderflow. This is the
old school stuff that a lot of people in
the pits used to only look at these two
tools the time and sales and the depth
of market and trade just out of those
without even looking at price charts. So
it's going to be very awesome. And then
we're going to have reading deep print.
So everything that relates to orderflow
candles and what is commonly known as
footprint charts
and reading the volume profile. So this
is we get deep into tools that take
order flow and translate it in a visual
way in a way that we can follow the big
money.
Then we have reading the VWAP which is
um as you all know a very important
institutional reference for fragmenting
orders and increasing execution alpha.
And we're going to understand how to
read it, how to set it up and
everything. uh we're going to read the
CVD which is a cumulative volume delta
indicator that basically takes the
aggregate of uh the order flow you see
inside of a session basically displays
it in a way that clearly shows you
market pressure in a very intuitive way.
Then we're going to understand the
basics of the liquidity auction theory
and the actual market theory model. Uh
the types of auctions seen from the
footprint chart,
some typical footprint patterns and
finally the session flow. how does the
auction flows inside of a session? Is
there a rhythm that we can follow
throughout every single day? Um, and
that we can read through orderflow. So,
this is what you're going to learn learn
inside of this course. Um, we're
probably going to make these slides
available for you anyways. And
you're going to be able to download
them. You're going to be able to
re-watch them. You can re-watch this
course how many times you want. I
strongly advise you to watch it as many
times as you need to truly grasp and
understand everything because we're
going to go deep deep deep into all of
the good stuff. And don't worry if at
the beginning as a beginner it's going
to be a little bit harder to maybe catch
up with everything. I can assure you if
I'm going to try my absolute best to
make it super super super duper simple
and to
you know remind you to rewatch it at
least a couple times. Okay? at least a
couple times. It's really really needed
to properly understand everything. So
maybe take pen and paper if you feel
like or download the slides and then I
don't know scratch on them and you know
u
sketch some drawings on top of it or
whatever and
enjoy the course.

Hi and welcome to lesson number one of
the orderflow mastery course by deep
charts. In this first lesson, we'll
first understand what is orderflow and
why you should use it in the first
place.
So
price candlesticks are a phenomenal
tool. Okay, just reading candlestick is
a already a pretty powerful way to
analyze markets if you do it in the
right way.
Still,
just using candlesticks,
I personally
objectively
think it's just like using a good old
bow and arrow, right? Does it work? Yes.
Does it still, you know, can you still
hit the target?
Yes, but it's a primitive tool.
It it was born in the 1950s, sorry, in
the 1850s.
So, it has a great legacy, but it's also
somewhat obsolete, even though it is
still very actual.
When you hop onto Orderflow,
you're using a ballistic bow, for
example, it's the same thing.
You can be more powerful. You can be
more precise.
You can have more tools at your disposal
to allow you to make you more precise,
hit further targets,
hit targets with a much higher accuracy.
That's what orderflow is. That's why we
put candles on steroids, how I like to
say,
because we want to improve the tools we
have in the first place
to give us a better informationational
edge and advantage on most traders.
So, can you hit the target with both of
these tools? Yes,
absolutely. Yes. But which one increases
your edge?
of course the second one. So that's the
one you should master to begin with.
That's why we want to study orderflow.
That's why we want to use orderflow
charts
to get anformational advantage. If we
are a detective
and we do not
take into consideration all of the
evidence,
we could arrive to the wrong
conclusions.
So you cannot allow yourself as a
detective of market to not detect
crucial information.
That's what orderflow is. And that's why
that's the language you should master
because we're trying to understand the
language of markets, right?
And price is the result of that
language.
It's the verbs. It's the words. It's the
verbal part of the language of the
language of the markets.
But orderflow
is the root.
Orderflow is the emotions of the
language. Orderflow is the details and
the body language.
Orderflow is the deeper layer of
understanding the language of the
markets. And if you are going to be able
to master orderflow,
you're going to reach a deeper level of
narrative that simply cannot be
understood just by looking at price.
You can assume it through price. You can
guess it through price. Sometimes in an
accurate way, sometimes not really.
So master orderflow
let's make a few example of the types of
orderflow tools that exist and that you
as a member of deep chart will be able
to use.
First one is is the footprint chart and
um as we call it the dip print because
it has a vast array of
types of visualizations and
orderflow dynamic visualizations
that make it deeper than most footprint
charts you see.
And it basically showcases aggressive
buyers on this side in the in the green
side of the candle in the right hand
side of the candle
and aggressive sellers on this other
side
which is the purple part.
And all of these aggressive sellers
and aggressive buyers
have an interaction with passive buyers
and passive seller respectively.
So, aggressive buyers buys from passive
sellers and you see them here. Okay. So,
here 88 contracts were bought and sold,
okay, at the same time because if
there's a buyer, there needs to be a
seller. So, this one is buyers who
accepted paying higher prices. These
ones are sellers who accepted paying
lower prices. And we'll go right deep
into what this exactly means
very shortly, but I invite you just to
look at this for example, right? This
was a candle that went down at first.
So, we had the open here and the candle
went down and it found
a so-called iceberg order, a wall of
orders that no price action trader can
even imagine is there.
And right after that, you had a huge run
to the buy side.
These things you cannot see with price
action. Well, that's why we use
footprint charts because we can see
things that are simply not seenable
through price.
You have a huge seller here trying to
push down, but there's a huge buyers
blocking that inertia and then pumping
right price up with a momentum ignition
and shooting market orders in the market
and filling the order order book and
eating it out completely. So this is one
of the tools. Another tools is you know
all of the wide range of volumetric
charts
and you get the volume profile or volume
by price which basically tells you how
much volume was traded at every single
level of price either of this session
with the session volume profile or
cumulatively in all of the charts that
you see which is the cumulative volume
profile
and it's called volume by price because
it tells you the total volume of trading
of
trading activity, buying and selling
activity at each level of price. So it
indirectly tells you how much money was
traded here. How much money changed
hands inside of this price range at this
specific time.
So this is a very powerful and crucial
indicator to follow the big money in the
markets because you know you just know
that wherever there's big areas
and big big big trading volume is
because there's a big big big big big
trader. If there's thousands and
thousands and thousands of contracts all
stacked in a single price level, it
cannot be a retail.
It's probably institutional algorithms
getting their fill, right? Or really
really big traders.
So
we have them per level of price
and also by time. This is volume by
time. And volume by time tells us
how much participation was there in a
price swing.
How much activity, how much interest and
participation was there in a determined
price movement?
That's volume by time. And it comes also
in a vast array of ways and and and
different visualizations and fashions.
Then you have the liquidity heat map
which is another amazing tool
that you might know as deep do or deep
map.
that basically showcases passive
sellers. So all of the sell liquidity
resting in the order book waiting for an
aggressor to come and pick it up.
So the market maker liquidity. Okay,
this is called the market maker
liquidity. We have passive sellers and
passive buyers. And we can have an heat
map that shows us the historical
depth of market which is you know this
liquidity this passive buyers and
sellers also in the past. So it tells us
with a heat map which are the areas with
the highest level
of institutional liquidity
of market making liquidity.
There's huge areas with
ridiculous amounts
of market making liquidity. Hundreds,
thousands of contracts, layers and
stacked all in a single price range that
price can simply cannot go through that
easily and that acts as support and
resistance. The same here
a big big big level of liquidity that as
soon as gets deleted it's completely ran
through.
This is other crucial information
to take informed trading decisions.
Then you have all of the world of volume
based indicators which are absolutely
phenomenal tools like the VWAP that we
mentioned like the CVD the volume
weighted average price which is not just
a you know um an EMA or that type of
chart. It is an institutional reference
reference which is widely used as a beex
execution
algorithm
and reference
and then you have CBD which is the
cumulative volume delta which again is a
measure of who's more aggressive who's
more passive okay
so what is behind these tools well a
flow of orders buy and sell orders aka
supply and demand.
An orderflow chart are a summary of the
decisions of market participants. It
shows you how and why
price did or will do something and it
gives you a clear picture of who's
dominating the market. Auction
at a specific time
with a level of clarity and accuracy
that price action alone simply cannot
provide.
It's pure, it's pure and raw trading
data that most retail traders are
actively choosing to stay blind to
because it's too complicated and now
that's your advantage.
Now let's go quickly through some best
use cases for orderflow. Where is best
to use it? Well, for day trading
absolutely yes. For scalping that's
where you can give your best with
orderflow.
for swing trading. Yeah, not necessarily
orderflow per se. So footprint charts
and short-term orderflow liquidity
dynamics.
But for swing trading, if you are a
swing trader, if you want to be and
become a swing traders, volume profiles
are an absolutely crucial and phenomenal
tool to assess which one are the areas
with the highest likelihood of having a
responsive type of auction that will
move price up or down.
So, if you're swinging traders and
you're not using volume profiles, you're
missing on a bunch of cool stuff. Now,
the best time frames to use orderflow
are typically I'm talking about
footprint charts and short-term
orderflow dynamics, of course, the
15-second charts up to the 1 minute, the
3 minute, the 5 minute chart. The more
you go up, the more noise you're going
to see and the less you're going to be
able to take advantage of short-term
orderflow dynamics and the more you're
going to have to realize that the tool
that can help you is actually volume
profile. But for shortterm time frames,
that's when order gives its absolute
best. Now, the types of asset in which
you can read orderflow are basically
anything that has some centralized
exchange, right? Right? So you have
futures contracts based on equity
indices like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ
but also commodities like gold or US oil
or you know equity indices like FDAX.
Then the equity and the stock market. So
single stocks they also provide volume
and
the cryptocurrency market even though as
it's traded over over the counter in
many different exchanges you have to at
least aggregate the volume and the you
know the trading activity data from
a variety of different exchanges like I
don't know Coinbase and Bybit and
Binance. You need to put them all
together and have them in a single
chart, which is something that is going
to be delivered in our technologies very
soon. And yeah, anything that has some
level of centralized exchange or that
can be aggregated in a way that makes
sense
is a potential orderflow tradable asset
class.
Now the types of strategies
you can literally build any type of
strategy with orderflow because remember
orderflow is a tool is not a strategy is
an a tool that helps you have a clearer
vision and a clearer understanding of
current market sentiment and mechanics
and pressure and initiative and
responsiveness.
It's not a strategy in and of itself.
It's a tool to build strategies and
narratives
and you can use it for breakouts and
retests, min reversions, momentum
trading, intraday swings, literally
anything that is intraday scalping.
Orderflow can help you
now. So,
so get ready and I will see you. So, get
ready. Whatever type of strategies you
use, even if even if it's a price action
strategy, if it's an intraday or
scalping strategy, you're going to find
help inside of this course, of this
program, of the software.
Just take time to learn the language and
you will discover a next level
offormational advantage that will help
support and facilitate your trading
decisions.

Hi and welcome back to the course. Uh
this is futures 101 understanding
futures contract. So we're going to get
deep into futures contracts and how they
work. Um let's first clarify what are
derivative contracts in financial
markets.
You have a distinction that you need to
make because a lot of people say I trade
forex. Yes, but that's an asset class.
Okay. I trade futures. Well, that's a
contract. Do you trade futures or forex?
Well, I could trade forex futures. So,
we need to properly differentiate what
is forex, what is futures, what's a
contract compared to an asset class, a
market, an underlying asset. So
underlying assets or markets, you know,
uh asset classes and market types are
for example, you know, currencies, the
forex market or commodities
or bonds, the bond market, stock market,
the cryptocurrency market. These are
underlying assets, assets that lie
under.
So they are the base.
derivative contracts instead is what we
actually trade. We don't trade by buying
and selling physical gold
or physical oil or by actually going to
a foreign exchange desk and changing our
money literally, right?
We normally trade contracts. Of course,
if you're speculators, you also can buy
underlying asset like stocks and bonds
and cryptos, but likely if you're a
shortterm speculator, not an investor
necessarily,
you're going to use derivative contracts
and you have many of them. You have
CFDs, options, futures, swaps, and
others. And let's make an example just
to make you understand. For example, if
the underlying asset is the exchange
rate between euro and dollar, which is
eurousd,
a CFD, a contract for difference might
be eurousd.
A futures contract might be 6E.
If it's gold, you're going to have the
CFD, which is typically X AUSD,
and the futures, which is GC. It's a
different type of contract.
So, for example, here, yes, it's forex,
but it's forex CFD and forex futures.
This is gold, gold CFD, and gold
futures.
The S&P 500, for example, the US 500 for
CFDs, and the ES for the E- Mini future
contract.
Some facts about future contracts that
you need to know is a future contract
technically gives the right to the buyer
to buy the underlying asset as at a
future date or expiration.
So yes, they expire. Some expire every
month, every three months, every six
months depending on the contract. But
they have an expiration
where you either buy the the underlying
asset or sell for example
or you roll over the contract. You roll
the contract over. So you basically
roll it to the next expiration.
and they were born for hedging purposes
in commodities. Uh that's why we have
the commodities future trading
commission which is the CFTC which also
releases the coot report the very famous
coot report which by the way is based
off trading activity of futures
contracts. Okay.
And as I said futures contracts were
born for hedging purposes in commodities
a long time ago. Okay. Like imagine IKEA
right? Imagine you're IKEA and you build
furniture. Well, you're going to need a
lot of wood, right? So, if you expect
the prices of wood to rise in the
future, instead of waiting until the
price rises, you can buy a future now, a
wood futures that gives you the right to
buy the underlying asset at a future
date. So, you buy it now, maybe at 100,
in the next few months.
The wood may rise in price, but you
still buy it at 100. Similarly to what
happens to an option in some way, even
though it's completely different, but
this is the idea, right? You hedge the
risk of commodity price rising by buying
a future. That's what the
original and most vast use of futures
contracts was. And then with the you
know
the upcoming financial futures market
they became also a speculative asset
class a speculative type of contract not
just for hedging purposes.
Now some features of futures or futures
features sorry for the the the
word play they are centralized and
regulated. So unlike CFDs that are
traded OTC are a very untransparent
lowgrade lowquality low transparency
type of asset class and type of
derivative contract that are not traded
all at the same place all in one
exchange but are traded in a variety of
different brokers and banks and
liquidity providers that are very very
difficult to put all together to kind of
come up with some trading activity and
reliable volume data.
Futures are centralized and they are
regulated in the way they transact.
Unlike CFDs,
they may require higher margins that
CFDs depending on the brokers. Some
brokers are like really really good with
margins. You don't need a lot of money
to trade futures. You can open an
account with I think as low as a hundred
or $500 maybe to trade micro contracts.
So, it's completely doable for, you
know, people who cannot afford, you
know,
to have $50,000 of their account.
It depends on the broker, but margins
are doable, let's say. And to trade
them, you only need to pay commissions,
though. There's zero spread markup from
brokers. A lot of you people coming from
the Forex space might know that CFD
brokers apply a extra spread on top of
the market spread because they want to
earn more money from your trading
activity. Maybe you've been through a
signal room uh and you didn't realize
that your guru, your favorite guru with
an offshore broker put a three pips
spread on Euro dollar that normally
should be zero, right?
That does not happen in futures
market because they're regulated,
because they're centralized, because
they're professional contracts. They're
professional trading tools.
The biggest futures exchanges include
the CME, the Chicago mercantile
exchange,
the COMX,
the URX, the NYX, the IC,
and a lot of other exchanges around the
world. And since they are traded in a
single exchange, we can pay the exchange
a monthly fee to access all of the
exchange
order flow and trading activity through
a so-called data feed.
So basically
we can download the trading data the
trading activity data from
the exchange itself through something
called a real time data feed
which is orderflow
and another features of futures is that
there's no fractional lots okay so
there's no contracts like CFDs
mini lots and microl lots 0.01 01 0.10.
So you cannot fraction
a contract but you have micro contracts.
So you have mini contracts which is
basically your one lot and micro
contracts which are basically your 0.10
but they still count as one. So you
cannot fraction contracts.

Welcome back to the futures introduction
course. This is future 102 ticker
symbols.
Um futures contracts has
have names also known as tickers or
symbols that are structured in a way
like this. This is the ESM26. Let's
understand what that means exactly. So
the ES is typically the first two
letters are or maybe three letters are
the contract name. So it's the E- mini
S&P 500 which stay and stands for the
underlying asset S&P 500 E- mini
contract.
This is the table that you can
screenshot if you want of the most
popular uh contracts. You can find it
anyways inside of the deep charts
platform. As soon as you select an
instrument, they're all divided by, you
know, exchange and the symbol and the
description. So, typically you're going
to find the ES, the NASDAQ, and the
micro version in the CME together with
all of the forex. And on the Seabbot,
you're going to find bonds, commodities,
um the Dow Jones, for example. And in
the ComX, you find a lot of commodities,
uh, and especially actually, uh, metals.
So you're going to find gold, micro
gold, copper, silver futures, and in the
URX, you're going to find Euro stocks,
FDAX, and in the NSAX, you're going to
find crude oil, natural gas, and a bunch
of other ones that you can find here all
the time. You can just simply type to
filter, and you're going to find them.
Now, the middle letter, it's a symbol
that normally stands for, it's normally
a letter, sometimes it's just directly
the number, but just for your
information, it's the expiration month
symbol. So the ESM26 is the ES contract
expiring on the month of June 2026. This
is the table of the month symbols if you
want to screenshot it. So we have F
January, G February, H March, J April, K
May, N M June and so on and so forth.
And in our platform though, you you just
have it like this. So ES 2025 12. So you
know it's December already. So you don't
need to to come up with a bunch of
letters and you don't need to memorize
them. So, of course, try and make it
easy as possible for you.

Hi and welcome back to the futures
trading course uh futures 103. We're
going to talk about tick size and tick
volume tick value. So the tick size is
basically how big is a tick number-wise.
So if if we look at at at a price ladder
right at price you got lower prices and
higher prices right a tick is the
smallest step possible in the price
ladder.
So the minimum
variation of price
of the futures ES contract
is in this case 0.25 points. So you can
see 25 50 25 sorry 75 0 0 then again 25
50 75 and so on and so forth both up and
down and one point is four ticks. So if
you go from 95 to 96
0, you're going to go up one, two,
three, four ticks. Okay?
And tick value instead is if I for
example buy or sell one ES contract, how
much money
will I see floating up and down in my
P&L?
So, for example, if I buy one ES
contract, that will create a change up
or down of $12.5 per tick or $50 a
point. So, for example, I bought here
at 68.9550,
my P&L is zero. As soon as I go up one
tick is 1250, up one tick 25, up one
tick 7 uh 3750 62 and so on and so
forth. And if of course price goes down
because I bought I'm going to lose 12.5
25 3750 and so on and so forth.
For micro contracts instead
a micro contract like the mees will
typically be onetenth or 15th of the
tick value of the let's say mini
contract. So the micro contract will be
1.25 point uh dollars per tick or $5 per
point, right? $50 a point, $5 a point,
one10enth because you see from 9550 to
9650 that's $50
and that is tick value.

Hi and welcome back to deep charts. In
this futures trading course and this is
futures 104. You're going to learn the
types of trading orders and OCOs and
hedging inside of futures. This is very
important lesson, crucial lesson if
you've just traded CFDs before because
it's going to teach you how trading with
futures actually works and how it is
different with all of the market orders,
stops, orders, blah blah blah blah blah.
So,
uh, please be really mindful about this
lesson, especially if you have never
traded futures before. So, let's bring
onto our screen our
deep charts. And we're going to have a
normal chart here. And on this other
side of the screen, we're going to get
the order book. I'm going to maybe put
them like this a little bit. Yeah.
Awesome. So, how does
the trading actually works? Right.
So basically I have this trading
terminal over here that has five type of
orders. Okay. Uh the buy limit is very
easy. I'm going to place a buy limit for
example below the current level of price
and wait for that order to get filled.
And as you can see I have it here. I can
see it here. Right? I cannot put the
limit order up. Right? Because if I put
it it's going to open it market. Look at
this. If I'm going to release it now. 3
2 1. There you go. It's opened market.
So, you might really want to be careful
about this, right? If you place a limit,
it has to be below price. And we're
going to be exactly like any buy limit.
We're going to wait for price to reach a
little bit down and then fill the order.
Nope, it's not filling it. Okay, we can
do the same with the by placing it here.
So, we're going to just wait and boom,
we're filled. So, you put it below price
and then you can simply know drag the
stop loss and the takerit
like you would do normally. But as you
can see,
this is a minus one limit. This is a
minus one stop. So, take profits for buy
um positions are limit orders are sell
limit orders. And if you go inside here,
you will see you have a sell limit right
over here and a sell stop right over
here because limits are typically for
sells above price and sell stops are
below price. Right? So as soon as this
is closed,
there you go. My position is zero. So I
basically bought here, sold here. But as
you can see, there's still my stop loss
over there that I have to manually get
rid of. And that can be kind of annoying
sometimes. And that's why OCO strategies
come into place. So, for example, if I
place an OCO strategy with a stop-loss,
let's say, of
50 ticks
and I buy market, it's going to
automatically, do you see this little
symbol here?
So if I for example place a takeprofit
here or I close my trade the stop loss
will be automatically cancelled.
OCO stands for one cancels other.
So instead of going and for example
buying market
without an OCO strategy. So, I'm going
to just
buy
and then put a sell stop here to close
and put a sell limit here to close. And
as soon as it's closed, this one is
going to be stay on the chart. With an
OCO strategy, I can make sure that that
doesn't happen. Okay?
And this is even easier on deep charts
because you can simply you know place
your
projection and then simply enter order
and it will automatically create a OCO
strategy for you. This is something
really normal for futures contracts but
we try to make it simple like this also
for you know former CFDs or forex
traders.
And by click clicking cancel you can
simply you know cancel every order that
you put in the book. And
again that's buying market. Buying limit
would be placing a buy limit here or
selling limit will be placing a sell
limit above current price.
But let's say for example I want to
trade only when this wick was broken.
What I can do is place a sell stop
slightly below that and this cell will
be activated if and only if price
reaches below that. Okay. And it
doesn't. So awesome.
Same thing if for example let's say I
want to buy I can buy stop only if I see
this candle broken up.
And there you go. I got filled
and price broke out and we're profiting.
So that's awesome, right? Okay. And
that's how buy stops and sell stops
work.
So as you can also see if I for example
buy again now and then let's say price
goes up from here.
Hopefully it goes. Yep. Let's say now I
want to sell because I think price is
going to go down. Well, I cannot simply
sell just like I would do on CFDs and
hedge my my buy position with a sell
position. I cannot do that. I have to
because if I click sell and now my net
position is plus one that simply means
I'm long one contract. If I'm going to
sell, I'm not going to open an extra
sell position here. I'm just going to
close this one, right? Let me sell
market, for example. There you go. My
position is closed. My position is flat.
So if I wanted to for example buy first
and then maybe sell to hedge my
position, I have to go for example on
the MES
on the micro and open 10 contracts of
these
so that I can buy one contract on the ES
and hedge myself with the MEES.
So that's how you hedge in case you ever
need it, which I highly doubt that will
be a frequent case scenario.
But you know, for everything that
relates trading and orders and how to
place them, stop-loss, take profit,
OCOs, and hedging, that's all you need
to know. Now, I would strongly advise
you to open your Deep Charts platform
and testing placing orders in a demo
account with a 15-minute delay data feed
just to test because we're going to
provide you a SIM account anyways. Test
how to place orders if you haven't yet
and really get to understand how they
work, how they're canled, what happens,
you know, if you don't connect them, uh
try to to, you know, just cancel or just
to flat the entire position, blah blah
blah blah blah. So give it a quick test
and I will see you in the next video.
