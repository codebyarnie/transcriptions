Hi and welcome back to this orderflow
mastery course. In this new chapter,
we're going to start talking about
orderflow tools. And the first orderflow
tools we're going to talk about today is
times in sales. This was also commonly
referred to as the tape.
You hear people talk about tape reading
while looking at price. That's [ __ ]
hilarious. Let me tell you this.
The tape
was
literally a piece of paper that was
constantly being printed every time
there was a transaction. Hey, one
transaction, one transaction at this
price at this time.
Again, printed one transaction at this
price at this time. One transaction at
this time at this price. blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah. A tape that was
constantly being printed
in literally a tape,
a physical tape of paper
that now exists under a digital form of
course and that we can see through deep
charts. So we're going to open new
advanced time and sales.
This is a normal time in sales.
Let's make it slightly bigger for you
guys.
And let's make the not only this one
bigger, but we can also make the numbers
look slightly bigger if you're looking
this from your phone because I know you
guys are doing stuff from their phone
and are not professional traders yet
that have huge screens and stuff. Um,
just kidding. Uh, so we're going to go
on settings.
and increase the font size by
let's make it 22.
Let's put a very black color. I like it
black. So once you go black
you
anyways.
There you go. So
this is a normal time in sales. Uh we're
now in replay mode.
because it's uh it's the weekend so
markets are closed
and let's play
and let's see how this evolves. You see
there's a lot of 1111 orders and per
every second there's more contracts
coming in.
This is the time in sales. Let me pause
that real quick. This basically tells us
one contract sold market
at 687925
at this time 190035.
This is the rawest form of order flow
you can possibly find.
Okay.
And something very interesting is
original gangsters
of orderflow trading were only trading
with these two charts
time and sales and orderflow.
Go and look at the story of Navinder
Sarra,
a guy
who allegedly, even though it's, you
know, we all we all know it's not true,
crashed the stock market in 2008 during
the flash crash, but something we know
for sure is that he was using and he
learned trading
with these two charts,
a time in sales and an order book. and
he managed to make $50 million
by of course manipulating the order
book. So that's not advisable but he was
very he was very successful even without
any type of market manipulation because
orderflow you know changed through time
high frequency trading is now a big part
of the orderful you see in fact you see
all of these 1111 orders like why would
I even need them right
and so he you know he kind of raged
against the machines and basically
started manipulating the machines
instead so this is a awesome very
legendary story. Um, but he was doing
something illegal which is called
spoofing which sometimes you can
actually see in the market still being
done even though it's completely legal.
We'll go deep into that pattern. It's a
it's a book pattern.
But he was using these two tools. He
didn't need any price. He was just
looking at the interaction of buyers and
sellers and he just knew where price
were going to go.
This stuff you could do it in 2004.
Right now it's way harder because the
fast is the speed of the tape is really
fast. Really, really fast. And we have
an indicator for that as well, by the
way. It's called speed of tape. Anyways,
how do we translate this into something
a little more useful, right? Because
this is, you know, not always useful.
Well, uh, let's go to settings again.
And
from input data, instead of clicking
volume,
we're going to go with aggregate trades.
And this will use MBO data
because a lot of these 1111
are
little pieces of the same order.
So they could have the same order ID.
And with MBO data,
we can sum them up. Let's apply.
Oh, look at that. Will you look at that?
I still didn't put a filter, by the way,
because you can filter and say, "Hey, I
want to see at least, you know, minimum
20 contracts." Okay,
you can do that. Now it's minimum 20
contracts,
but you didn't have it before.
aggregate trades.
It's a in the time and sales an advanced
function that basically
reagregates all of those 1111 one one
that are just simple volume. But thanks
to MBO data,
thanks to the fact that we can
have an order ID
that we can see that those four 46 1111
contract were actually 146 order
and as you move on and
close this. So let's close this. Let's
apply and say okay.
Going to keep playing and you're going
to see only the orders that matters.
Well, that's a better way to visualize
it. But it's still very raw.
It's still very,
you know, it's a completely different
way of reading what's happening in the
market. I get it. But this you need to
know this because this is the basics of
what then becomes footprint charts and
volume etc etc etc.
And there's a lot of settings here. I'm
not a huge user of it but
you can literally customize it however
you want. There's a lot of settings like
a lot of settings you can put alerts and
it could be useful you know just to keep
it on the screen on the side of the
screen but this is not yet the sauce
okay
so this is the time in sales

Hi and welcome back to this orderflow
course. Orderflow mastery by deep
charts. This is orderflow tools 102
depth of market
or dome.
This is the depth of market. This is the
DOM. And what the DOM is, as we've
understood, and you've probably seen me
already using this a couple times, is
the summary of the order book, right?
And
in the price ladder, what are all the
orders in the bid and in the ask?
And we use this and a lot of traders
simply use this to trade. One of the my
you know uh best trader friends Serge is
you know a part of the team together
with Tom behind the world trading
champion Patrick Nail. He's just using
this to trade. Sometimes he can simply
trade just by using it just by looking
at this chart. If you look at Navindra
Saro he was also trading with this. I
personally have never traded with this
alone. I would have a really hard time
because I need to look at price. I need
to look at, you know, uh the auction
overall. But there are a lot of scalpers
and traders that simply use this,
which is unconceivable unconceivable for
me as a former price action trader.
This is normality in the trading pits.
We're just trading using the order book.
Now, we're in a replay mode. So, I'm
going to press play and we're going to
see the auction develop in real time.
And you can see price moving up and
down, up and down. Everything we've seen
until now
in real time
just from the side of the book. And you
can see, for example, that all of the
orders that are put here are changing.
Look at this 150. 1 2 3 4 5 9 because
people are deleting these orders.
They're reststacking them on top.
They're putting them, they're taking
them off, putting back in, putting back
off.
And you can see price going up and down.
But we don't see the executions
actually, right? We just see this and
price going up and down. We want to see
also the sales, right? So we can
activate, for example, a resettable
volume profile.
And let's reset it for a second.
There you go. Well, now we can see not
only
the movement of price and the movement
of the book, but how much money was
traded there.
This is crucial information
to have in your order book in your dom
in your depth of market. We can see
there's a very big seller here. For
example, we have 145 contracts
ready to be sold here.
And then price just moving up and down,
up and down, up and down. And market
makers
getting eaten alive. Okay. And on this
side, you can see the volume profile
shaping itself
and telling us how much money was traded
in a specific price level. And from this
one, from this type of tool, we can spot
anomalies in the short-term order flow.
And for example, we could have instead
of just this, we could have a delta
profile that tells us, for example, who
was more aggressive and eventually who
was absorbing, which is very useful. We
had a a lot of buying going on here. A
lot of aggressive buying that now has a
follow through and some of the sellers
were that was here that were here were
deleted. Okay, we don't see them
anymore. So, one could for example buy.
Now, I'm doing it completely randomly,
guys. So, don't just don't take it as a
trade. Um, and for example, if I buy
here, I can literally just buy directly
from the book, right? And I can put a
buy limit here or for example here
and maybe follow the price. Let's see if
this one gets filled as well.
Yep, almost there. And as soon as price
gets here, we're going to get filled.
And I could place, for example, a sell
limit here. You see, I can just trade
inside of the book and add my orders on
top of those ones. This going to be
closing my position, right? Because it's
a I'm already bought one contract. I'm
long one contract.
And this is going to be my take profit.
It's going to close my one contract by
selling it. Okay. Now, we have three
contracts open. See, they're getting
filled. And I can put a stop order here.
And I can basically trade directly
through the depth of market. I can place
my orders inside of the book just like
in a just like I'm interacting in real
time with the market with the order
book. This is absolutely fascinating
stuff. And but aside from being just
fascinating,
you can see the evolution of the auction
in real time, see liquidity being pulled
and stacked,
seeing with the volume profile where
most of the trading happened. Now, for
example, we just broke through a very
high volume node. It's likely that we're
going to move down a little more. Now,
look at this. 995 contracts offered
here. This is an anomaly right there. So
I for example I can flatten and this one
contract is likely going to be executed.
Look at this.
There was a huge seller and a big buyer
that bought it right away.
You have 900 contracts being executed
here. So for example, I might join the
party and start buying as well and place
my stop below here. And if there's a
momentic ignition right here and price
pumping up the famous fu that uh Fabio
made famous, there you go. I can just
take a quick scalp and get out of the
market. Okay, this is the type of
trading that I'm far from being an
expert of it. Okay, but this is the type
of
anomalies that you're kind of looking
for
and kind of taking advantage advantage
of in the order book. It's a very
frenetic way. It's a very hectic way of
of of trading of course. Um but this is
one of the way this tool is being used
and that you can simply keep there to to
to see the the auction develop in real
time to you know keep a look on the big
orders. You don't need to just look at
all the numbers. Just look at what
happens when there's a big order. Okay,
there's a big order. Might be careful,
right? And here you can monitor also how
fast the book is going, how fast the
tape, the so-called speed of tape.
And that can tell you a lot about
trading activity. Typically, when you
see fast trading like now, you know, the
tape moving really, really fast, you can
kind of assume that that price movement
might continue, right?
And there you go. This is the order
book. There's a lot of stuff that you
can do here. There's a lot of stuff that
you can um set. You can have for example
a bid ask uh footprint. Now all of that
absorption error was completely walk
through. So we might expect some selling
activity for example and
you can either have the fundamental here
which is like just some basic you know
uh percentage volume the total volume
blah blah blah some some basic orderflow
uh data. You can either also hide the
trading panel if you don't want it. You
can uh
not have anything at all and just have a
clean book.
And you can completely customize by the
way in the settings what types of column
do you want, right? So for example,
yeah, that's the bit column. You can
change the color. For example, I might
want to change it at, you know, green
and this one with this green.
And now I have it in a different color.
Okay.
And
I can add a pool stack column that
basically if I click okay, let's see.
Tells me the variation
of how much was put in the book or taken
away from the book. Okay,
this is the pool in stack.
I can have a filled column. So, how many
orders were actually filled? Let me take
off this pull stack. I can have a
filled. So, it's going to tell me the
orders that were actually filled. So,
it's basically like a footprint chart in
real time.
So, how many orders were filled? So,
in the bid and in the ask.
Okay. And I can see them with numbers
without requiring the the the the bid
ask volume profile. So I can just keep a
for example volume normal volume profile
here have the you know
footprint in the middle and also maybe
have a delta footprint. So this can be a
very complete way of looking at the
markets in real time. And I can add many
other columns. For example, offers,
order settings,
what color do you want them? What color
you want the price scales? Do you want
the P&L? Do you want to see the P&L
column with the money going up and down?
Or you can just delete it and not have
it at all. And that's pretty much what
you need to know about the depth of
market and how you can use this. A lot
of professionals use this. It's an
amazing tool. It's a different type of
visualization. I know it. And I strongly
advise you to spend some time looking at
the book because it's the rawest form of
orderflow and it's one of probably the
best ways to get to know orderflow to
get to understand the language to learn
how to read the auction. So I strongly
advise you to do that even with a replay
just like we're doing right now. And
that's it for the depth of market. I
will see you in the next video.

Hi and welcome back to this orderflow
course, orderflow tools 103. We're going
to get to know the deep print, also
known as orderflow candles, deep
candles, footprint,
candles on steroids,
or however you want to call it. So,
we're going to take a normal chart.
Okay. Or we can simply go on deep
charts, you know, in the main bar and
click new price chart. Right? You're
going to select your
E- mini S&P and voila, you have the
chart, the same one that I have here.
Now, I'm going to close this.
And one of the options you have to do it
very quickly and swiftly
is to for example
activate orderflow bid ask right from
here
and it's going to build a chart for you
and if you zoom in
you're going to be able to see the bid
ask footprint.
Now let's go down drop into some minor
time frames
and let's go to the one minute time
frame. This is one of the time frame I
prefer to read the footprint chart
and this is one type of visualization.
Okay,
it could be improved I would say right
so let's make it better. We can go here.
This is just the basic version, right?
Uh but you can go inside here and all of
the settings pops up.
So this is a ask bid
footprint chart, right? So it's just
showing you orders that hit the bid on
this side and lifted the ask on this
other side. So aggressive selling and
aggressive buying.
You can also have it a volume, right?
Just the total volume here
or you can have just the delta. Okay, so
the difference between total volume ask
bid and delta is
the total volume is simply doing this
number plus this number.
Delta is doing this number minus this
number.
That's it. Super easy. So 81 + 110.
Let's put volume. Um let's let's first
make the text slightly bigger because
now is the font size. It's pretty
practically invisible for you guys
probably. So let me put that really big.
There you go.
Is 191. the total volume
81 + 110
110 minus 81
so I put delta it's 29 right
and you can have it as a box now it's
it's written box
um because we don't see the background
of it but you can go on plot settings
background ground and for example
color mode fixed.
And now you can see a little bit of the
background
or fading color which is what typically
I use or multiple colors
and the color calculation. How do you
want it to be colored? based on volume
or based on delta
or dominant volume
or volume dominant delta.
To be honest, I always give it a delta
to keep it simple.
And
the background is this one. So, for
example, I might want to put it a little
bit more lighter.
Yeah.
And for example, I want to put my text
with a main color being
[Music]
on the text settings.
Yeah, text settings coloration.
I'm going to put it black.
Yes, I prefer it, for example, like
this. But to be honest, I have my
template for this. My one minute entry
template
that is going to load now, but it's
going to load a little bit more because
I typically have 60 days of chart to
load. So, let's give it a little bit of
time to load.
And there you have it. I'm going to take
off all the rest of the stuff that we're
going to see later in the course.
And there you go. Look how beautiful and
clean this is. My god. I make it even
cleaner by putting the chart area black,
just how I like it. And there you go.
Nice. So
let's have this one here
and in the properties let's make
indicators autoflow analyzer or dip
print
let's make in the plot setting the text
slightly bigger
and let's get to know our footprint
chart. So a quick reminder of how this
works. Let's have this on the side and
this here.
And with our replay, we're going to play
and we're going to see this thing
developed side by side with our depth of
market in real time.
There you go.
Now you can see both of them moving at
the same time.
And this is basically summarizing the
end result of what happens here. So we
have passive buyers, passive sellers,
the volume profile and this simply tells
us okay this is the summary of all
aggressive buying the summary of all
aggressive selling. So you can also
guess here what happened in the book
because if you see for example just like
we saw slightly before
this happening in the book we saw a big
$900 order.
Sorry a big 900 contracts order.
Well that's where it is.
We don't see it. We don't see it before.
Right here we can see it before it gets
filled. Here we see it only once it gets
filled, which is ultimately what
matters, right? Some might argue what
actually matters is executed orders, not
fake orders that have been spoofed here.
So maybe they put it, they take it off,
they put it again, they take it off.
It's unreliable information. So I'm just
going to stick with what matters and
just have the orders that were actually
executed. That's a stance I can
understand.
Okay. So this is what the footprint
chart does or the diprint does. It shows
us the summary of the auction that
created the candle.
This is the best way to analyze
market movements
and it gives us some very important
data. So let's kind of diversify all of
these colors, what they mean, etc.
The background color is green. Here it's
purple. And the darker it gets, the
higher the delta.
So you're going to compare the number of
this with the number of this. And if
this one is increasingly more than this
one,
this one is going to get greener. Same
thing here. 68 2007. Well, this one is
going to get colored purple. Okay. So
the delta
as we discussed is this minus this or
this minus this. So the color is based
on delta.
The color of the text instead is based
on something called auction imbalance.
And by auction imbalance what we mean is
the imbalance between what was traded
and bought from the ask.
So what was bought from the ask and what
was sold in the bid in that auction
because you know you always have the
best bid and the best ask at one tick
difference right here. Let me let me
pause this for a second.
So you always have
best bid at 50. Sorry, best ask at 50,
best bid at 25.
So
this is the best ask. Sorry, now this is
the best bid. This is the best ask,
right? So this is how the auction
unfolds diagonally.
So this is the this is one auction,
right?
Best bid, best task, best bid, best
task, best bid, best task. So there's
always this
diagonal
representation of it, right? That's why
we have zero here and zero here for
example. Right?
So it's going like this. It's going like
this.
And then typically you have zero here
and zero here. That's what also we call
when you have a zero and a zero. We call
this a finished auction. And we call
this a finished auction.
When we see a number here instead of the
zero or a number here instead of the
zero like here as well, we call it an
unfinished
auction. Okay? And we typically expect
those levels to be taken out. But you
know whether they take it out or the
statistical advantage of it. I'm not
going to give you any guarantee on that.
But this is something that you know a
lot of orderflow traders are actually
looking at. Um
so these numbers are colored based on
the imbalance between
what was traded in the best bid and in
the ask in that auction. So diagonally
speaking. So you compare 78 with three.
Well that's a big imbalance. And we
measure the imbalance typically in
percentage. So you will see a slightly
light blue color when there's a at least
a 200%
imbalance
and a very highlighted
light blue color when there is at least
a 400%
imbalance.
So this number being at least four times
bigger than this number.
Same here in purple, light purple.
You're going to see if there's
an imbalance of at least 200%.
And in case the imbalance
is
more than four times, so more than 400%,
you're going to see it very
punchy and with a big highlight
when it's 400%.
And in some situations,
you know, you're going to see both.
You're going to see both a high color
indicating the imbalance, a high color
in the background indicating delta,
and that's where you know there's
something real going on. Right? This is
called this is a a clear example of of
absorption.
And this instead this yellow box that I
can see here is the point of control. So
the point of the candle p
which is the point in the candle where
the most the highest amount of volume
was executed.
Okay.
And these are all really crucial data
points in my opinion to formulate a
hypothesis of what's going on in the
market on who's dominating in the
markets.
Because for example here, you know,
there was a lot of aggressive buying
happening and there was a big seller in
the book.
Well, we tried that didn't work and then
we poked out of it and as soon as it got
broken then we have a long auction that
lasts for quite some time.
Right? So, what the footprint is doing
is showing us a picture, a very clear
picture of the auction. And in the
tutorial section of your user area
inside of deep charts, you're going to
be able to find everything that relates
to every single thing about the
footprint chart. But I'm going to go
quickly through it. Um, you're going to
also you can also able to have, for
example, as I said, a volume, but not
box because this is the box version, but
a profile version. for example, it's
going to show you a profile instead of a
single box of that level. Right?
This is one other type of visualization
of this. Uh if you want to set for
example a different type of imbalance,
you can go to plot settings and in the
text
coloration settings, you're going to
open them and the color mode here is
multiple color based on imbalance. I can
go to range and set userdefined range.
And you're going to be able to see here
that the first range is all black. So
the basic color is black. Second range
is not enabled. You have third range,
fourth range. You can set even different
ranges. Okay? I have the 200 and the
400% that I told you. So with the 200 is
light blue, light purple, light pink.
400% is punchy blue, punchy pink. You
could even get crazier with this. Okay?
You can have a f a fifth range when
there's a you know 600 or a,000%
imbalance right and you know put it when
put it in I don't know a very different
color red for example
and
you're going to apply and save
put it back to ask bid
And now you're going to see also those
red when there's a huge huge huge huge
huge imbalance. Right?
And this is the footprint chart. Okay,
this is the basics of the footprint
chart. And I personally like this for
example to put multiple footprint charts
on top. For example, my five minute time
frame template for the footprint.
I'm going to show it to you now. Just
give one second to load.
So, it's going to load the chart now and
you know rebuild the chart based on a
different version of the footprint
chart.
And there you have it. This is another
type of visualization of the same chart
but on a five minute time frame
and with both the bid and the ask
where you have both the bid and the ask
and a volume profile. So I have the
volume profile that tells me where the
most money was traded in general. The
footprint chart with a beat version that
tells me who was more aggressive and the
volume profile chart itself is colored
through delta. So I have all of the
informations I need all in a single
chart where I can basically put one
chart on top of the other one. Okay. And
the cool thing about this is for example
I might go and you know have in the
indicators tab both orderflow uh
analyzers and I might not want them one
on top of each other. I might for
example go to advanced and have it half
of the size with
a half of an offset and have this on the
side. And then go to the settings of the
other one. Go to advanced again. Have it
half of the size again
but without any offset.
And I can simply split my profile my um
footprint sorry into two and have them
split instead. And this is how
customizable it is. And with all these
customization you can literally get
every type of visualization that you
want. And I strongly advise you through
time to find your way to personalize
your charts to uh you know play with the
settings a little bit. See the type of
orderflow imbalances that are important
for you. The type of colors that you
need, the type of information that you
think you need and you want to get out
of this uh deep print indicator because
it's super customizable. It can, you
know, get you to the point where you
have all the information you need. And
we're going to provide you with all of
these templates, of course, but you
know, this is everything you need to
know about the footprint chart and on
how to use it and how we're going to
read it and all of the details. We're
going to go deep into the next few
lessons. for this lesson. That's all.

Hi and welcome back to this orderflow
mastery course by deep charts. Uh in
this video we're going to take a look at
orderflow tools 104 deep profile or
volume profile. Another crucial tool to
understand where the money is going to
assess market structure to individualize
auction moments and the best areas of
volutric support and volumetric
resistance.
So this is a daily volume profile. Okay.
And as the word says, it's the profile
of volume. So volume by price tells us
how much volume was traded per level of
price. How much money was traded per
level of price. Okay? And
you can very clearly see there's
different types of zones, there's
different types of areas, there's
different types of colors. And we're
going to go through all of that in this
video right now. So the first thing you
can notice is there's different colors,
right? And
you get an orange area over here and a
gray area outside. The orange area is
also known as the value area. Okay? So
the area where most volume was traded.
We'll get deep into how much volume was
traded exactly in that area very soon.
The other thing that you can clearly see
is
peaks highlighted in
purple or pink. And we call them peaks
or high volume nodes. Okay? And you can
see from
the volume profile areas where there was
a lot of trading activity going on,
areas where a lot of volume was traded,
right?
We call these high volume nodes or
peaks. And then you have white areas,
right? These guys.
And these are basically low volume
nodes. So
points where the volume is considerably
lower than let's say the rest. So you
have peaks and you have these that are
also called valleys.
And
in general,
areas where there's a lot of volume,
areas where there's less volume. Okay?
And
what this means is price and the market
itself spend a lot of times into high
volume areas and traded a lot of money.
Okay,
in these areas there was not a lot of
money traded in this area as well.
And
we call this area the fair value area
because both
aggressive sellers
and aggressive buyers and passive
sellers and passive buyers were mostly
agreeing that the best price to trade
the best area of price to trade is this
one. So what you will probably see from
the price action that is uh you know
derived from this volume activity will
likely be something like this.
Okay, where there's not a lot of price
action going on here. So not a lot of
volume being traded around
and a lot of trading volume and a lot of
trading activity and a lot of trading
being done at these prices
for a long time as well. Okay.
And
this shows you how much money was traded
in a single day or in a single session,
however you set it. And how the volume
is often distributed. And the area that
is currently highlighted, also known as
the fair value area, is
derived from a specific number that
comes from the normal distribution of
probabilities in a sample or the
Gaussian curve,
which is also known as the standard
deviation, the first standard deviation.
And we'll understand now what that is
because that's crucial to understand.
Um,
in most things that we can measure, in
most events that we can measure with big
samples of data, you will likely see
something very similar to this curve,
right?
And
34% of the samples typically will tend
to be
within this average range
which we call the first standard
deviation.
This is the second standard deviation.
This is the third standard deviation.
Okay.
So
within the first standard deviation you
will see 68% around 70% let's say of the
samples
within the second standard deviation
you'll have 95% in the third standard
deviation you'll have 99%.
And this is true and common and
observable
in a lot of samples of data. For
example, the length of penises,
the average length of penises,
if you look at the distribution of the
length of penises, it will have this
sort of distribution where most of the
people will have an average sized penis
and a few people will have
super small or super big sized penises.
This is the distribution of male height.
And also here
it has this shape right where you have a
lot of people in the average area from
165 to 175.
Very few people above 180 which is six
foot around six foot and very few people
below that.
So
whatever we try and measure
will tend in nature to have this sort of
distribution of probability. So getting
back to this you will have
a 68% probability of ending up between
this range.
you will have 13% probability of falling
between this range 2% probability of
falling under this range.
So
this is where most elements are and
these are where the fewest elements tend
to be. Okay.
And with the volume profile, we can
assume kind of the same because we can
take how the distribution is
all the distribution of volume
throughout that day and we'll see where
most of the volume was traded. And we
know that volumetrically speaking,
moneywise,
this was the first standard deviation.
And so we also know that whatever
happens outside of
This range is statistically speaking
related to the volume traded during that
day an anomaly.
And
both outside these areas and inside of
this area,
crucial moments in the action of money
and order flow happen throughout a day.
because there's some you know
tendencies that price or the market will
have when you reach these
areas of price.
So here I have plotted in the chart the
volume profile of the cash session of
each cash session. And as you can see
clearly
the areas where price spent the most
time are the areas where most volume was
traded. Okay. A lot of time spent here.
A lot of trading activity happened here.
And these are the areas where you could
expect in the future sessions as well
some level of trading activity and
reversal from the areas where you get
out of a fair valuation.
So
what you will typically do in any
scenario like this is taking the ledges
outside of the first standard deviation
and also in the following session.
You'll see that pretty much those are
the areas where
you have a higher likelihood of seeing
rejections from price because if during
a specific session price consider these
prices to be fair or better buyers and
sellers on the aggressive side and on
the passive side consider these prices
to be fair.
There is some level of likelihood that
if we get further out
from this fair valuation of the previous
day, we will get back inside.
Trade back inside of it. Test the same
areas where
these buyers and sellers agreed to
auction higher until we reach something
similar to the previous area. and then
back down again up from here and that's
where we stop once more. So these areas
act as a
actual support and resistance and not
because price is bouncing there multiple
times but because there is something
making price bounce there multiple times
which is institutional interest and
money.
Now
of course with the benefit of hind
hindsight you know all of the areas are
going to work super super good. So this
is again not a
law but
I strongly advise you to go back in time
and not just go back in time but also
with a forwardlooking type of approach.
take these
high value, high volume level areas and
see how they react.
See how price in the following sessions
react to these areas because a lot of
the auction market theory models come
exactly for this. We have a fair
valuation here. Price opens in the
following session outside and fastly
very quickly breaks back inside. The
first reaction happens where here
price tries to auction outside of the
fair valuation
but the auction is not ready yet. So we
jump right back inside. And when we do
that where do we test here
and once that auction is exhausted
then we move on to the other side of the
value area. Okay. So
this is something that you will see
happening all throughout
sessions throughout you know
days and weeks in the weekly profiles
and the daily profiles etc etc and you
will see this happening all the time.
For example, this is the previous fair
value area.
And in the following sessions, this is
the area that pretty much keeps the
market in check. So
this is our area.
This is where most of the money was
traded. This was where most
institutional
traders and investors and HFTs and
long-term traders were agreeing is a
fair price.
Session closes here.
Following session opens.
First thing we do is we auction lower.
We bounce right back from the previous
area of support which is our value area.
We test it one more time. We reach the
other side. There you go. Failed auction
one. Tries to auction higher. One more
auction.
Goes higher. Can't manage to do it. And
then you get, you know, you will just
see what happens with orderflow here. We
drop back inside. almost get to the
other side, test, and then run to the
other side. Okay,
next session. We're open inside of the
fair value area, which is this one.
And another thing really cool thing you
can do is click
and
of course just click on the volume
profile per se
volume profile merge plus and it's going
to merge the two volume profiles. So now
you have one big fair valuation area
which is more precise
and considering the volume of two
sessions right because they were
basically overlapping. So when the
following cash s cash session opens,
you'll see a very aggressive sell
momentum that bounces where? Right here.
And when finally we break below it, we
have a very intense
sell auction because of all of the
aggression that happens when we get
outside of these areas. Because outside
of these areas is where the anomalies
happen.
Because statistically speaking, most of
the trading is done here. And most of
the selling happens when we try to get
outside of here, for example, and most
of the buying always happened when we
try to get below here because we are
outside of the normal distribution and
of the statistical probability that
price will stay inside of that area. So
whatever goes outside is an anomaly.
That's where opportunities happen.
An opportunity to buy at a discount
compared to the normal distribution
because you are you are statistically
speaking looking at money at a valuation
that is outside normal. And so there is
always going to be some form of
reversion to the mean
either from the downside or either from
the upside.
And these are the areas where most of
the aggressive selling would happen,
aggressive buying would happen and
protection from passive participants
from the sell side and from the buy side
will happen.
But whenever we manage to break with
strength outside of these areas,
well, that's where volume increases
and we're ready for a new auction. But
before managing to
flip the auction completely, where do we
test
the same area?
Because the same sellers that allowed
this to happen are considering these
prices premium. So they will still
consider them as premium prices compared
to the volume, not compared to some
Fibonacci, not compared to anything else
but money.
And we drop down for the rest of the
session.
We open. We have this as the main
valuation of the previous session. Even
though it was very directional, but look
at where you find rejections,
rejections, rejections. Same level, same
area.
And when we break back inside,
we understand this was
a bigger version, just a bigger version
of this, which is a failed auction.
And we understand that once we get back
inside, these are the same areas where
we'll auction test and go to the other
side once more. This is the power of
volume profile. This is the power of the
auction market theory that we will get
even deeper into later. And one of the
levels that you will find in the volume
profile is the point of control. And the
point of control is
personally not one of the
let's say a lot of people
overestimate it
because there's some level of randomness
right there's some level of randomness
involved in where
the highest level of volume the highest
the absolute highest single tick
where most volume was traded
do not have in my does not have in my
opinion a great statistical reference as
much as this, right?
Because you know it could be here. It
could be it could have been this one
with a couple more contracts. It could
have been this one with a couple more
contracts. Could have been you know this
one with a couple more contracts or this
one pretty much the same, right? So the
single point you know a lot of people
say yeah just place a pending order here
and sell from the point of control.
Yeah, you know what? That's not you know
it's not a reliable model. That's not a
reliable statistical reference. It's
simp it could be more random. There's a
lot of trading activity going on.
There's a lot of algorithms involved in
the price action. So I would not
consider the point of control itself to
be the main statistical reference. What
you could argue with, you know, a little
bit more,
you know,
rationality involved is not the point of
control itself, but the areas with a
volume peak, that may be an area of
institutional interest. Yes, absolutely.
Yes.
the areas of low volume though
as well
because those prices were considered
unfair and that's where you see also a a
lot a lot of reaction from price.
So you can have a daily profile just
like this one. You can merge them and
then you can have for example a weekly
profile. There's all sorts of profiles.
You could have a
deep profile,
add it to your chart.
You can put it on volume on delta
and you can have a composite volume
profile
which basically is going to give you a
profile of the entire chart you're
looking at.
If you do this to look at long-term
areas of interesting volume activity, I
kind of advise you to
go to the plot settings
and in the visual appearance align it to
the right.
get rid of the value area
and just look at
the main areas.
Just look at ledges. And by ledges, I
mean whenever you see
from a big volume spike to a low volume
node, you're going to take all of that
area. That's your ledge.
from a big to a low.
And basically whatever is inside could
be considered as your value area. When
you see sudden drops in volumes, that's
your ledges.
That's where you see a lot of reactions
coming from.
And this is pretty much all of the
basics that you need to know about the
volume profile. We'll get deep into that
practically also in the next, you know,
uh, sessions. But this is what you need
to know about the volume profile. I'll
see you in the next

17.
Hi and welcome back to orderflow
mastery. This is orderflow tools 105
deep stats or orderflow values. Um this
is an indicator that I think it's very
very useful for scalpers and traders um
that can be summarized in different
ways, can be visualized in different
ways. There's so many data. Um, and it's
basically a table that shows you the
values of each candles related to
orderflow. And this is how it looks
like. It's the chart down here.
And based on how you set it up, it will
give you some information. Okay?
and
you just find it in the indicators under
deep stats or orderflow values.
And there's a lot of them. Okay, there's
literally a lot of them. We're not going
to go through all of them. Now, I'll
tell you my favorite ones on this
indicator specifically are total volume,
delta volume,
and delta percentage.
So you want I want you to go to delta
volume, select text, delta volume,
select text, not ignore.
You're probably going to get delta NT. I
I want you to put ignore and delta
percentage text. That's how you activate
it. And that's how you have it. Now, uh
let me show you a little bit how it
works and how it's calculated. Uh when
you take a footprint chart just like
this one, you're going to have
As a reminder, as a as a reminder, ask
traded. So buy aggressive buy orders
that lifted the ask. So traded on the
ask, aggressive buyers and bid traded.
So aggressive sellers accepting sell
offers. Sorry, accepting buy offers and
selling to the bid, hitting the bid.
So this would be the total bid traded
and this will be the total ask traded.
So if you sum it up 19
total bid traded and 20 total ask traded
you get the total volume. So bid traded
plus ask traded is the total volume
which in this case would be 39.
If you do bid traded minus ask traded
you get the volume delta.
Okay. So you take all the bought minus
all the sold aggressively
and you get this.
That's volume delta.
So delta is answering to the question
who was more aggressive.
Who was the predominantly aggressive
participant inside of this candle and by
how many contracts?
By how much?
Well, one over around 40 contracts. It's
not a lot, right? Buyers were like this
was a pretty balanced candle if you look
at the effort that was put in,
but the result is sell. So, you want to
use delta always in the context of
effort versus result,
which is you know the basics of volume
spread analysis. And you know if we go
even back to the early stages of Waco
theory.
So whenever you take a look at order of
flow stats in this
table here, this is what you'd normally
see. Total volume on the orange one,
which is the total volume traded on each
candle.
the volume delta.
So instead of doing
bid or better ask traded minus sorry
plus bid traded you're going to do ask
traded minus bit traded and you get the
delta. So the delta tells you the net
aggression of a candle.
But as we will see, it could also mean
absorption.
This one here is the delta percentage.
So in percentage compared to the total
volume of the candle, how much of that
volume was aggressive selling? In this
case, 6%. In this case, 20%. In this
case, 10% was buying, aggressive buying.
So it gives us
with a very simple number
a summary of the order flow of each
candle. So it's very very useful and
this will come in very handy to spot
significant candles. For example,
inside here
inside this chart area in this time
frame you had 2.6 6 2.6 2.3 1.7 1.7 3.2
3.2 1.6 5.9
Well, this is a candle that is has way
more volume than all the rest of them.
And we also see that it has an a huge
delta compared to the other ones.
Hence, a huge delta percentage compared
to the previous ones.
Plus, it's a very big candle. And you
will see if you look at in what's
happening inside, you will see that
there's something going on here, right?
There's a big sell
aggressive series of orders that are
trying to be blocked by a buyer and
eventually that buyer fails.
Sellers, this big big sellers are in
control and the auction moves lower.
This is stuff that you simply do not see
with price action. Okay,
so a big trader, there was a war between
two big traders here. One was in the
bid, one was selling onto it
and one prevailed clearly
and sold thousands of contracts and
caused a huge swing in price.
This is an extremely good sign for a
breakout. It's just objective that
during this breakout there was a lot
more volume. There was a lot more money
involved in this candle that you simply
cannot see. Even this candle was big.
This candle was big. Yes.
But this candle had volume. This candle
has institute clear institutional
interest that you can see with numbers,
not by guessing.
This was a wall of orders that got
completely ran through
and we moved below.
And this is the power of orderflow. And
we can use this as our map for overall
orderflow activity.
And you will start noticing something.
You'll start noticing, for example, that
most of the breakouts, not all of them,
but most of the breakouts that hold
happen to be high volume breakouts.
For example, here, what you'll typically
see during a breakout is an increase in
volume.
So, we had this as a main range
at 4,000 5,000ish.
And whenever we break out,
look at this. 8,000 contracts, 700
delta, which is at least 10%.
And then we move high.
Whenever there's
a lot of volume, a lot of aggression, a
lot of delta, typically
the breakout will hold because there's
an imbalance. There's a clear imbalance.
And again here,
you can't compare.
Oh, there was a lot of selling going on
here, right? All of aggressive selling.
18% delta 1.2,000. Where where are they?
Very small candle. Why? Oh, look at
that. Something went on here. Something
was absorbed here.
Interesting.
But what happened after? We tried to
auction lower. Absorbed again.
This is a big ass candle, but a flat
delta. That's a discrepancy.
And what happened here? Oh, there was an
aggressive buyer that got absorbed as
well. So I can start seeing first I have
my indication below here
and then I can go like a detective into
the details and realize a lot of
liquidity here, a lot of liquidity here,
a lot of money here, a lot of money
here. Okay, so this is what we also call
a liquidity pocket. So a specific area
with a lot of liquidity, a lot of
trading going on. And once that's broken
through as well, guess what happens?
We move higher. How do we break?
We break above the range.
What happens? High volume again. Five,
five, five, six, seven. 15% delta, 20%
delta, big aggression. Boom. And we fly
higher. Okay.
So, this is how this tool can be useful.
I'll see you in the next

18
Hi and welcome back to orderflow
mastery. This is orderflow tools 106
cumulative volume delta. very powerful
indicator um that takes something
similar to what we've seen in the
previous indicator with the orderflow
values and basically plots it on a chart
which is even easier to understand and
gives us a different perspective around
delta and around market pressure.
So
we take the same chart and we add this
on top which is the cumulative volume
delta. You can find here in indicators
cumulative volume delta
candlesticks.
So let's take
this as an example
where
and let's start from the beginning of
the session because that's where the
cumulative volume delta starts
happening. Let's say
so
let me make it wider for you.
Yeah. So as you will see
every day the cumulative volume delta
will start from level zero right
level zero.
And
by plotting candlestick it will show you
how delta varies throughout a candle.
And for example,
if we have
a delta of 51,
the candle will go up
around
51.
If the delta of the following candle is
- 9, well, this will go - 9.
If there's a -26,
the candle will be big and go -26.
+ 71 + 71. So
the only difference between this one and
this one is this one is cumulative. So
it takes into consideration the total
delta of the entire session and shows
you how the delta varies throughout the
session.
And you can quickly compare it with
price action and make some interesting
consideration and building a narrative
around what price is doing compared to
what the pressure of aggressors
is doing. Okay.
So for example,
in a situation like this one,
you could notice, for example, that
during
this situation where you had one swing
low, swings slightly lower and then
high.
What did you have from the volume delta?
Well, let's see.
You had
the delta and the pressure going down
and then not plotting another low.
So whenever you see that in this leg
price went down and in this leg price
went down but
the delta didn't
it clearly shows us that there was more
effort
on this leg
that caused price to drop.
There was not as much effort on this
one.
Big effort, big result, not a lot of
effort, but still some result.
So this thing tells us that in this leg
of price, there was less aggression,
less interest, less participation.
In fact, that's what a lot of
orderflow traders calls this a lack of
participation pattern.
So whenever you see price doing this
plotting a low and the volume delta
not plotting a low so there's a
divergence of this type we call this a
lack of participation
because during the second leg of price
the aggressive sellers that caused the
movement are not that present.
typically.
Now let's make some sort of opposite
example where you see that this leg went
down in price. You had a leg down in
delta.
Price went back up
and then another leg down. And here you
have this and this.
So you have an opposite example
where
during this leg a lot of effort brought
a lower low
result
and here a lot of effort
did not bring a lot of results.
That's an interesting data point because
it can tells us that for example there's
divergence of this
low compared to this
lower low.
And if you take the same ones in the
CVD, you'll see this.
And that typically happens during
absorptions
because this effort did not bring to a
result in price while this effort did.
This lag created a lag that went lower.
This leg
went lower.
but not in price.
Big effort, less results.
So we typically call this pattern
absorption.
So if this
is a lack of participation in the
movement,
this
is a lot of effort in this movement. but
very low results. So absorption. So this
is what we call an absorption
in the CBD. These are the two main
patterns. You know this is the classical
bread and butter of CBD. Okay. But you
want to look at this in the very short
time frame. Typically you don't want to
look at it on a session perspective
because it can be misleading at times.
You'll see for entire sessions this
delta going up and price going down.
That's completely normal. Look at this
one.
That just means that
in this price swing, buyers were more
aggressive
were more on the aggressive side and
sellers were more present in the book on
the passive side. So they were more
absorbed throughout this whole thing
down. This could be a whole absorption,
right? But we don't need this. It's not
useful to assess
long-term price
movements.
It's really useful for short-term
divergences. So, a lot of scalpers will
use this type of divergence.
Uh I personally
prefer to use this in combination with
the footprint because in the footprint I
can not only spot absorptions very
easily but I can see where they are and
what happened right after. So this is a
cool summary. Yes, but I wouldn't say
it's 100 1,000% necessary. Okay.
But it's a very valuable indicator that
you can use. Absolutely.
So this was the CVD and in the live
sessions you will also see let's say
more practical examples but this is all
you need to know about one of the main
orderflow tools.


16.1
Hi and welcome back to Orderflow Tools.
This is Orderflow Tools 107 VWAP or
volume weighted average price.
And this is a very interesting
indicator. really really interesting
volume level
which is basically
the average price weighted by volume. So
it's just like a
an average, right? Sort of a moving
average you could say you could argue,
but that takes into consideration
also the volume. So what was the average
price where the average volume was
traded?
And for example, in a session, you know,
after a session, this might be the VWAP,
the volume weighted average price. For
example, in a session like this,
you could see maybe at the end of the
session, this would be the VWAP,
but it develops throughout the whole
session. It start here and then it
follows price typically, right? So you
can see the development of the VWAP
throughout the day.
And why is this important is because
it is knowingly it's it's very known to
be an institutional reference for
filling orders because this is
objectively telling you
the volume volume weighted average
price. So if you have a VWAP, you know,
if this is the VWAP of a session,
anything below the VWAP is objectively
discount
based on the price and based of the
volume.
Anything above this will be
premium objectively
based on price and volume based on
money.
Let's take an example here and
we have plotted here the VWAP right and
the VWAP you can simply create an
orderflow u VBP values or deep profile
values go to the VWAP enable it and
enable the developing VWAP and this will
appear exactly like this. So every
session has its own
volume weighted average price
moving up and down. And you'll see that
a lot of the times this will be the
level that they'll keep buying and
selling at and it will serve as an area
of support or resistance or a breakout
type of thing. Even better than that, as
we know that this is a dynamic
representation of fair value. So we
could call it a dynamic fair value.
So the adapted average fair value of the
day. We can also use the same
statistical concept of
standard deviation
and plot standard deviation bands all
around it.
So we go into the settings and activate
the envelopes. And in the settings
we set the first envelope with a
standard deviation parameter of one.
I have typically 1.5 standard deviation.
two standard deviations
and three standard deviations. So I
normally have one, two and three. You
can have 1.5, one, 2.5, however you like
it. We apply it and we get these bands.
And these
are again
just like we did with the volume profile
where we had
most of the volume traded here and
anomalies happening outside and that's
where we look for trade opportunities
not in the middle right because that's
where the average goes.
Same thing happens here. The only thing
is
this is the first standard deviation.
This is the second standard deviation.
This is the third standard deviation.
Right? So remember our bell curve. Our
bell curve will be something like this.
It's the same thing but it's a not just
based on volume but based on volume and
price.
This is going to be the average and
these are the standard deviations from
the average. And whenever we reach the
second or third standard deviation,
that's where typically you're going to
see a lot of rejection and a lot of
the retracements and mean reversion
setups starting to happen. So you can
either use these as dynamic target
levels
or as extremes
where it could be worth considering
buying and selling to and from.
And these are let's say the most
statistically reliable
references
and they are widely used for best
execution algorithm in the institutional
space.
So they will if they want to sell for
that session they will try their best to
fill
above here and if they buy they'll try
their best to fill below here.
And that's just some what some what a
lot of firms do in case they have big
orders to pour into the market and they
want to have a better field. They just
take the VWAP as a reference and fill
above or below based on their uh trade
direction. So that's why this is such a
powerful tool. This is a powerful
institutional reference that you can
plot on top of your analysis. Don't
overuse it. Um or
maybe just you know focus but don't try
and put too many things on the chart.
Just take it as a reference. Uh but as a
reference that is backed by money is
backed by institutional order flow and
by statistical analysis.
