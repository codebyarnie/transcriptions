Hi and welcome back to this orderflow
course. In this section, we'll take a
look at SE session dynamics
and understand the flow and the rhythm
of the order flow
throughout every single day. Starting by
saying that there we have two main
session which is the extended or
electronic trading hours and the regular
trading hours.
And they are two radically different
sessions that you can simply spot if you
have a normal chart
from volume because you'll see you're
going to have a lot of volume in this
session and then basically zero then a
lot of volume
and then not a lot of volume and then a
lot of volume.
That is because
the official bell of the American stock
markets and of the CME starts
at 9:30 local time, 3:30 Central
European time, and ends at 400 p.m.
local time, 1000 p.m. Central European
time.
And that's our regular trading hours
session, also known as cash session
because that's where most of the money
is traded, where most of the big
movement comes, where most of the smart
money trades.
In the meantime though
some movement might might happen where
you have the Asian session, the London
session with slightly more volume and
activity and then again American market
session
and the way orderflow behaves in these
type of sessions and in the ext in the
extended trading hours is radically
different. Orderflow anomalies will work
way better during these times of day
because if there's a big fish, he's
going to be one of the few ones in these
sessions here. You'll have to read into
the war of a lot of big fishes of whales
and sharks and everyone is there joining
the party. HFTs, all sorts of traders,
you know, much more volume, much more
money, much more data to take into
consideration
here.
You're going to have a lot of silence
for a long time, but when you see a big
trader, you just see it. It's just
obvious.
Okay? And that's the main difference
between the regular trading hour and the
extended trading hours.

Hi and welcome to session dynamics 102
opening and closing auction. An
important part of the rhythm of the
money flow is the first part of the
session and the last part of a session.
And
what you will see if you look at a
normal volume chart, you'll see a lot of
volume at the beginning, then drying up,
maybe some spikes here and there in the
middle, typically during breakouts or
doing the reversals,
and then at the end, the very peak
of volume.
And that happens because
before market opens,
traders of all sizes and all sorts
can
send the exchange something called
market on open orders. So orders that
will be executed by the exchange in the
first few minutes of the market auction.
And you will typically have
released in financialjw.com which is a
free website for looking at news. This
is a data that you know you can you know
it's provided directly by the exchanges.
You will have a market on open imbalance
that for example in this case was
bearish. And as you can see the first
candle the first volume was with a very
green sorry with a very um purple delta.
So the market on open imbalance tells us
is there an imbalance between buying and
selling either aggressive or passive
and how much is that
throughout the session. Then
market participants of all sorts will
try to fill all of their orders but they
might not be able to fill all of them.
So the orders that they will not they
were not able to fill throughout the
sessions will enter the market at the
end of the session on the form of market
on close orders and
the exchange will release a market on
close imbalance.
An imbalance between buyers and sellers
of market on close orders. And even here
you can see on the S&P 500 we have minus
92 million. It's not much. We normally
see way more.
And you had a purple
clear
selling delta
type of volume. And that's where most
like the the single biggest volume
candle happens in every single session.
Okay, this is another session. It's
exactly the same. Little more at the
beginning,
pretty stable throughout the first part
of the session, low in the middle, then
typically
higher volume in the so-called power
hour. So, the last, let's say, next few
hours of the session, and then the big
boom of volume, which is normally
completely absorbed, by the way. This
normally does not very often cause big
price movement in the last five minutes
of the session because it's just a
settlement type of orderflow and it's
mostly, you know, filled mostly at the
same price. So that you're not going to
see a lot of um
movement typically in these parts of the
session. But let's take an example.
Let's take a let's take a look. Let's
take directly a look. And if you zoom
out with this type of template, you can
also see in a different way that this is
the extended trading hours and this is
the regular trading hours. More volume,
more color, more delta, more color. And
at the market on open you will have a
lot of volume,
a lot of trading activity,
a lot of absorptions going on here and
there,
a lot of darkness, a lot of delta and
big price swings.
Not always, but very often.
Then we wait until the end of the
session. We go to the end
and here you see we get close to the
closing of the session and you see most
of the volume being traded
the highest concentration of volume in
few candles and you'll see a lot of 1K
2K 1K a lot of volumes in the last part
of the cash cash session a lot of
absorption there's a feast of market
makers right at the end of the session
because they know there's a lot of
orders so they provide liquidity and
the candle of
2159 European time, 359
local time will typically have a lot of
contracts. The biggest one for 4 44,000
contracts in a single candle. Okay? And
that's the closing auction. That's what
happens because all of these market and
close orders are entering the market.
This is a very important thing you need
to know about the auctions in indices
and you know in most um futures trading
at the CME.

Hi and welcome back to orderflow mastery
course by deep charts session dynamics
103. We're going to take a look at the
typical daily auctions. So how does a
session typically
forms out?
you have you can distinguish between
clear directional sessions. So you're
going to see a lot of session that
starts directional and just keep going
for the entire session and then
find a balance. This one is an example.
Okay. And that's what you're typically
going to see
if in the first part of the session
there's a big amount
of price variation.
most of the average daily sorry daily
range ADR or ATR average true range
which is let's say the average excursion
of price in a single session which we
could say maybe for uh stock an average
for you know the stock market for the
S&P 500 and an average session might go
one%
up or 1% down very rough estimate well
if in the first part of the session we
already did plus 0.9%.
We went up almost 1% in the first part
of the session. There's a higher chance
that after all of this aggressive
buying, we'll find finally a situation
of balance. Okay?
And this is typically what happens. If
most of the movement happened in the
first part of the day, you're going to
see less volatility in the power hour
and most likely
consolidation at the end of the session,
which if you are trading
momentum or you're trading breakouts
might not be the optimal scenario for
you.
Then you're going to find situations
where you have
market starting from a situation of
balance. Okay.
And then pumping up
and you'll see high volume during the
breakout. Maybe a pullback. That's a
great idea. And if you want to take a
breakout trade, this is a good idea. If
you want to trade it here, well, we have
a high potential for volatility
throughout that day and then maybe
closing once
at least 50 to 60% of the ATR
have been fulfilled just like here,
right? Like this range breakout test
likely a lot of volume here. Awesome. we
trade and as soon as we see some
consolidation, we get the [ __ ] out and
that's our trade.
Another type of session that is often
common is a V- reversal session. A
session where it begins with
a very directional auction, typically
sell, but could be also a buy side
auction
and then a V reversal.
So,
not a lot of this very directional day,
but a very volatile day where price
swings can also be very
deep and retracements can be very deep.
For example, here we open down and then
we moved up for the entire session and
then we closed here.
And in these types of situation, you
might opt if you're a breakout trader
and you simply break out. Those days
could be a little bit annoying for you.
If you are a reversal trader that for
example here there's a big value area
zone, you know, and price opened here.
So maybe the last session closed here.
So you might expect a gap fill and so
you wait for this and then maybe buy it
back.
that can be a a good scenario for you.
Other sessions, and these are my least
favorite, is
the entirety of the session goes fully
sideways. This doesn't happen very
often, but when when it happens, it's
very annoying for especially for, you
know, breakout traders. For rangebound
trader, this is like the best day ever,
right?
Because here you can trade failed
auctions all day long. Literally all day
long.
And in these type of sessions during the
power hour, so let's say after let's say
1:00 p.m. local time or
700 p.m. Central European time. That's
when you get all of the directional
flow.
And maybe you you just wait all of the
day for a breakout that does not happen.
And if you constantly try and trade the
breakout, you get stopped, stopped,
stopped, stopped
and maybe you give up. Your trades for
the day are gone and then market
eventually goes. You know that can be
annoying for breakout traders.
But all of these sessions are common.
All of these session are very likely to
happen.
But it's a it's a very clear framework
to understand what type of session we
might be in today.

Hi and welcome back to orderflow mastery
session dynamics 104.
In this lesson, we'll take a look at the
initial balance breakout, which is one
of the highest performing historically
price action, let's say, patterns or
let's say statistically valid edge in
the markets. And the initial balance
breakout is something very simple. Um,
it basically takes the first 15 minutes
or 30 minutes
or 60 minutes of the session.
It takes that range
or that candle, plots the high plus the
low and whenever there's a candle
breaking out from that at the lower time
frame, for example, five minute time
frame,
you buy
or
you sell.
This is a very
I would say not very but decently old
strategy
uh invented in the 1990s
that has demonstrated to have a very
consistent edge throughout decades.
Okay, this is one example. You take this
is a five-minute chart. So you count
one, this is the first candle, two,
three, these are your 15 minutes. You
take the high, take the low, and you
trade the breakout. And that's a good
trade.
And this is the performance of
a opening range breakout strategy
risking 2% per trade
compared to the performance of just
buying and holding the S&P 500 started
from 2021
till more or less today.
And you can see that it has a better
sharp ratio, a smoother equity line and
a clear edge especially in times of very
directional markets.
In periods where maybe market are not
that directional
then this might suffer and you could
have you know
entire years where the performance is
not great. This is a long-term
perspective. Okay? So, this is just a a
bias, right? More or less 70% of the
time when there's an opening range
breakout, you have some level of
excursion. Okay? It's not 100%, guys.
It's not 100%. So if you're going to use
this type of model that then Fabio has
um
put on steroids with the IVB model which
is the initial volume breakout that he
will explain to you and that is
available in the deep charts full
version. Don't expect a 100% win rate
there can be
long periods of time where you don't see
a lot of profit. That's that's
completely normal because that's you
know a different type this is a very
mechanical edge right but with the right
context with volume analysis with
orderflow you can qualify breakouts in a
way that just by looking at cand candles
you simply can't
because the money will tell us if that
breakout will hold or not.
But it's an edge that has a consistency,
a very mechanical base because it's a
very easy strategy. It's not no big
deal, but that you can build on top of
that
your discretional narrative thanks to
real orderflow data.
So let's take the last
session as an example.
So the first 15 minutes
we had this as the low and
this
45 this as the high of the opening
range.
So this is our opening range
and what you want to see is a breakout
above and the breakout happens.
Let's put ourselves in the fivem minute
time frame just to have
so I'm going to load my favorite
fiveminut template. So for example, we
take a look
at what the volume does above here in
the five minute
and we might see that
there's a lot of aggressive selling that
is completely and utterly absorbed. So
there's a lot of volume, right? Volume
is increasing. There's a lot of volume
activity.
which means interest, which means
participation, which means the smart
money is there. But look at what
happened.
Yeah, it's all purple. But why? Because
look at this. All of this absorption of
sellers. Sellers tried to go here, but
they were completely absorbed from
buyers. So buyers are more active on the
passive side.
They completely absorb all sorts of
seller.
And that's a very clear indication that
this breakout
is very likely
going to continue. And there you go.
Again, also here, absorption at the
bottoms, exhaustion,
big imbalance
again at the top, a lot of sellers. What
happens to them? They're all absorbed.
This is the clearest you can get
on market mechanics. And this is how you
can take something very basic as a
opening range breakout or an initial
volume breakout, an initial balance and
thanks to volume being able to take
advantage of that with a very very clear
bias to begin with.

Hi and welcome back to the last uh
session dynamics
lesson 105 RTH gap fill. And the RTH gap
fill is nothing more than a gap between
the closing
price of the previous regular trading
hour session or the cash session
and the opening of the new one. If there
is a gap between them, we have a 68%
chance that it will get refilled. This
is another structural edge
of ES and NASDAQ just like
the opening range breakout. So these are
very mechanical ideas, very mechanical
edges where you on top of that can build
your discretionary narrative to
get to know orderflow a little bit
better but basing basing it on something
very solid to begin with to build to
start building the right habits. So in a
situation like this you might for
example see that here you have a very
big volume area that we can likely
bounce. we have a great deal of chance
that we'll fill this up. So, what I
would do here is maybe either wait for a
very big
signal or let's say u
good indication that buyers are in
control and either join the train on the
way or wait for a new consolidation
phase to happen and a breakout out of
that. So fractally looking for an
auction higher with you know ranges and
wait for a breakout in the same fashion
and stop below here target here. Really
easy trade. Really easy easy trade. You
don't have to over complicate it. You
can take a bias by looking at
where we are in the volume profile. If
we're inside and we want to ping pong,
if we're breaking out and want to look
at volume to continue
or you take the opening range breakout
and look at what happens during the
breakouts. If there's an initiative, if
there's volume, if there's initiative,
we continue.
Or same thing if this was the previous
session and now the previous session
opens here the next session open here
there's a gap perfect I'll try and sell
it as soon as I see some aggressive
selling kicking in and market auctioning
lower and lower these are two very three
four very simple ways to start
implementing orderflow analysis as a
confirmation for your entries given a
volume bias
or a statistical bias. Also, this
strategy, by the way, something similar
to this, um, has a decent edge overall.
So, this is a structural edge again. Um,
but this one, I would say, need a needs
a little bit more context. And let's try
now. Something very easy you can do is
click here and just delete and not have
the extended trading hour section on
chart. and you're basically going to
find yourself with a chart that by
itself just has the regular trading
hours without having to, you know,
create a custom session and all of that
stuff. So, we're going to wait for this
to load.
Yep. And in this situation, it's very
awesome because you had both edges at
the same time.
Let's take off the volume profile.
You had both a gap to fill and an
opening range breakout. I mean, that's
just free money, as Fabio would say.
You have all the confirmations we talked
about before,
plus an opening range breakout, plus a
gap fill. So, you had your target
preset.
Absolutely phenomenal.
So we break the opening range breakout.
So we have a very high probability that
we'll continue up. Plus we have a gap
that we have a very high probability of
filling. Plus the auction is on our
favor and buyers are absorbing any
sellers that tries to go lower.
This is just like very very high
percentage win rate stuff. And you can
just simply wait for a session like
this. You wait for a session to gap
down. You wait for an opening range to
be broken up. You see if there's a lot
of volume. And this is a extremely high
probability setup. Extremely high.
And this is how you take orderflow and
contextualize it with an edge
that is very very solid.
So
this was the orderflow mastery course.
We've been through all of the trading
tools that orderflow can provide. All of
the market mechanics that goes around
it. All of the auction market theory
model
that models the money flow. We've
understood the rhythm of the money flow
and some statistical edges based on the
rhythm of the money flow where we can
then use auction dynamics, short-term
auction dynamics in the footprint charts
to time our entries
with confidence.
