Hi and welcome back to the orderflow
mastery course. We're going to now start
the market micro mechanics 101 course
and
the first lesson is understanding the
auction.
So in the academic world
there's been a lot of studying on the
models of auctions and how they work.
Several nobel prizes in 2020 were
awarded because of the elaborated theory
of the auction.
And you typically have three types of
auction. You have a forward auction
which is the classical one where you
have a seller and a lot of buyers trying
to you know u get their hands on
whatever they're selling. You have a
reverse auction and a double auction.
The auction of
liquidity in the markets which is the
underlying mechanism that moves every
single market in the world
is a mix of a forward auction and a
double auction. Okay. where you have
both buyers and sellers interacting with
each other.
So, a classic Ford auction is something
you might have seen in the movies or
maybe you have attended one where
there's a bunch of paintings being sold
at the auction. There's a middleman, a
auctioneer with his little hammer
and all of the rich buyers that are
called the biders because they make a
bid, right? They offer a higher price
than everyone else.
So the participants of an auction, if we
have to categorize them, are the
auctioneer,
the paintings themselves, so the the
sellers, the the goods being sold at the
auction and the biders. And in this
case, the biders would be the demand,
the paintings would be the supply and
the auctioneer is the middleman, right?
And
in an auction, you would have again the
biders, the auctioneer and the painting
sold. And let's say the first price is
a,000.
Well, someone comes and says, I'll pay
a million and a 100,000.
So original price is 1 million. He's
going to pay 100k more. Well, awesome.
That's the new price. Who can offer
more?
Another guy come says, "I'll pay 1,200."
Awesome. That's yours unless someone
else is willing to pay a higher price.
So the price of the good
is determinated by this mechanism of is
there anyone willing to pay more. This
is an auction, right?
And the liquidity auction works exactly
the same way with the exact same type of
participants.
So you have the biders, the demand,
the auctioneer, the middleman, and the
paintings that are the supply. And the
supply is not of paintings, but it's a
supply of buy and sell orders. That's
why it's a double auction because
there's not just things being sold.
There's things being sold and things to
be bought. Both offered just like the
paintings in the auction.
they will not move price by themsel
because there's they're just the
paintings. Okay, someone else would
decide if that price is good and if
they're ready to pay a higher one. Then
that one would be the biders. So
the one who actually moves price up and
down, which is the demand of buy and
sell orders, the demand for paintings.
And the middleman, the auctioneer will
be the exchange in this case. So the
exchange facilitates the auction by
putting in contact
the demand for liquidity, the demand for
buy and sell orders,
and the supply of buy and sell orders.
Okay,
we'll call the supply of buy and sell
orders passive liquidity which is
displayed in the so-called central limit
order book and the demand for buy and
sell orders aggressive liquidity which
are simply market buyers and sellers. So
people who just like we did before are
clicking the buy market button.
Well, these are the limit orders, the
limit
buttons.
And of course in the middle in the
exchange everything is facilitated
through so-called matching algorithms
that we will get to know shortly.

Hi, and welcome back to the market
mechanics course. This is market
mechanics 103. And
how do we summarize what we've learned
all of this auction activity
in a chart that shows it?
So, we said that these two contracts are
matched, right? There's a buyers that's
matched with the seller. It's a match.
That's the new price. The candle opens.
Now, let's add one more layer. Let's
have a little table that summarizes for
us aggressive buyers on the right hand
side and aggressive sellers on the on
the left hand side.
So,
that buyer that bought we place it here.
So
two contracts here mean an aggressive
buyer was ready to accept to pay a
slightly worse price to get filled. This
is this doesn't mean there were two
contracts
bought or there were two buyers. Yes,
but there were also two sellers. Always
remember that.
And zero here
because no contract was sold
aggressively here. Another
one comes, takes two contracts at 101.
It's a match. Price moves up and we put
those two contracts here.
Big five contract order placed by an
aggressive sellers. Each those two
contracts at 99, those three contracts
as 98. So we place that five contract
now that this is the new price. Two that
were filled here and three that were
filled here.
and zero here of course.
So this is what we call a footprint
chart or a bid ask footprint chart.
It basically summarizes for us
what happened during the auction. What
caused price to move? What are the
orders that pushed market in a specific
direction? How many were they?
both from the aggressive, you know, side
and the passive side because if there
were three three contracts sold, they
were aggressively selling and passively
buying at the same time.
So, the bid footprint basically tells us
with a little bit more detail who was
the aggressive and who was the passive.
And if you want to summarize them, you
get the volume profile. Okay, the volume
profile is simply how much volume per
price. So the volume of transactions.
So here there was two transactions. Two
transactions, two three or even better
two order transacted, two orders
transacted, one, two contracts, even
better two contracts. Two contracts,
three contracts.
So we put them here.
just with a histogram, right?
So,
if this is a sell candle
now, let's say, you know, we we just
bounced right off of a resistance or
supply zone, however you want to call
it. So, price went up up up
sell candle. Well, a price action trader
would wait for this to sell, right? They
would wait
for a confirmation from price. Okay.
From price
that sellers are present and dominating
the market.
An orderful trader will see this
and already here he can see there was
first a lot of aggressive sellings. We
see a lot of red going on. But look at
here.
There was a buyer who tried to buy 50
contracts
and there was a seller willing to keep
selling to him.
This is what we call an absorption.
That's why it's crucial to understand
that these are not simply buyers. So,
there's a buyers price will go up. No,
how the how is the interaction
presenting itself to us? or the
interaction says there was someone
trying to buy but there was someone as
big
selling at the same time and price from
here did not go up.
It stayed exactly where it was despite
all of this buying,
all of this aggressive buying.
Well, clearly
passive sellers are in control here.
So it's not a surprise that right after
that we see imbalance. See 0 0 3 1. So a
lot of numbers here, low numbers here.
That's an imbalance.
So already from here we know that
sellers are dominating
while a price action trader would have
to wait for here to understand it
to even come close
to the precision
that orderflow can give you.
Is that clear?
I hope that's all clear.
and I will see you in the next video.

Hi and welcome back to market mechanics
in the orderflow mastery course from
deep charts.
In this video, we're going to go through
order matching
with a little more detail
and get deep into the rabbit hole of how
order matching works.
So this is a scheme I've prepared for
you guys that basically shows you
that for example a trader, a market
taker might buy market
and as soon as he sends and clicks the
buy market button,
that order from his broker through a
data feed
will go to the exchange. change
every order will be assigned if it's an
aggressive order an aggressor order ID.
So that order has a name. That order is
tracked by the exchange.
We know that order has a name. Okay,
it's sent through the broker through the
data feed to an exchange that through a
matching algorithm
will match it with
our dear order book which is made by
limit orders, right? Traders who placed
limit orders here. So, we can see the
path of that trader. That trader as a
market maker put a limit order, a
passive order that has its own ID, its
own identification,
its own name
through the broker, through the data
feed to the exchange placed in the book
and the matching algo
will
take this buy market order with this
aggressor ID. take this cell limit with
a passive order ID and match them.
And there's going to be a lot of orders
here, right? It's not just one trader.
There's probably thousands of traders in
the order book placing buy limits all
over the place. So,
who gets executed first?
That's what the matching algo is all
about.
So for example this is a first in first
out right I wrote first in first out.
So here you will have a queue of orders.
So the first order that was placed here
whatever quantity it is okay can be one
can be four whatever quantity that order
is whatever quantity of contracts that
order will be the first one in the queue
of the book. So chronologically
speaking, the first one who put their
order there will be the first one to get
filled.
Same thing with of course aggressive
buyers.
This is the FIFO, the first in first
out.
And there's many different types of
matching algorithms. We're going to go
deep into this one and discover another
very important one and very common one
in the next video.

11
Hi and welcome back to the market
mechanics course. This is market
mechanics 104 types of orderflow and
data feeds.
So whenever you're going to buy a data
feed,
you're going to get some level of data,
right? As we discussed, you need to
purchase a data feed that grants you
access to the orderflow data.
The first type is market by price data
feed level one top of book.
So when you get this
and you open your depth of market,
right, this guy, you're basically only
going to be able to see
the first two levels.
As you can see here, 100 and 99. I have
23 and 29, right? Only the first two.
So, you're going to see the total amount
per level of price
market by price.
Same with the orders. You're going to
see all of the orders coming inside.
That's all the data you get.
Or you can get a market by price data
feed level two that shows you the full
market depth.
This, for example, is a full depth book,
right? You can see a lot of levels
inside of the book.
So you see all the levels up, all the
levels down. You can see if there's
areas of liquidity that are significant.
For example, here I can clearly see if I
make this bigger that I have 160.
There's a big seller here.
And yeah, there's other big sellers
here. So, these are areas that are
likely going to be visited by buyers.
Okay.
But still, I just know the total amount.
The next level is
seeing every single order. Okay, because
here it can be, you know, this five
contracts could be one big five contract
order or multiple small orders of one
each.
That's market by order data
or level three MBO market by order.
So this is a granular version
of orderflow that not only
allows you to see the total amount
but also tells you if there's something
interesting if there is one order which
is radically bigger than all the others.
What are the big trades
both from the resting order because
every resting order has its own ID
and every aggressor order as well has
its own ID.
So both from the aggressors
and from the resting orders
thanks to MBO market by order data
the exchange is granting us access to
order ids. So our deep charts platform
can take these orders and replicate it
and take this data and plot it on a
chart in a way that we can filter out
the real big traders.
And that's the power of using a
technology like deep charts with an MBO
compatible data feed.
This is also useful to spot icebergs
because as you will learn later in this
course,
smart money tries to hide
and it is able to hide from price action
traders,
but
they cannot entirely hide from orderflow
traders.
And that is going to be all clear thanks
to MBO data.
So to summarize the features of each
type of data feed, you have market by
price level one, which is enough for
basic footprint charts. Volume profile,
you just need level one. No need for
level two. No need to pay a lot of
money,
which by the way, by the way, is $20 a
month. 20 or $30 a month. It's not good
for depth of market analysis. So, if you
want to see liquidity areas and stuff
like that, you're not going to be able
to see it with level one. With level
two, yes, you have the full access to
the DOM, to the depth of market, the
whole order book with all of the buyers
and the sellers and all of the liquidity
areas.
That's level two. It's essential,
especially if you want to use heat maps
like deep dome.
Level three data is crucial
because it provides
order ids that allow allows our
technology
to aggregate fractional trades and
native icebergs
which we'll get deep in the next
lessons. The most common futures data
feed are DX feed, rhythmic, and CQG.
rhythmic being the only one that has
fully accessible and fully let's say
um
playable with APIs.
So with rhythmic you can
see native icebergs specifically with DX
feed you can also have level three data
but you don't have there's some problems
with the APIs that that we're trying to
solve. Uh you can see big trades for
example with DX feed um but you're not
really seeing the icebergs. Okay, that's
that's a slight different that we're
going to get deep into later. Don't
worry if you don't understand what I'm
saying now. But um these are the most
common types. These are very high
quality data feeds. They're reliable and
you know, they're very very very solid.
They give you the real exact data with
probably the least amount of small
mistakes here and there, but almost
close to zero mistakes in the order
flow. So absolutely phenomenal tools. Uh
we're proud to have all of them in our
platforms and these are the most common
ones.

12
Hi and welcome back to the orderflow
mastery course. In this lesson of market
mechanics 105, we'll get to meet
different types of matching algorithms.
The first one, as we know, is the first
in first out system. So per every level
of price, we're going to have passive
buyers and passive sellers, right?
And
these are every single orders. Let's
see. Let's say this is market by order,
right? And let's say
any buyer or any seller comes. The first
order to be placed in the queue
chronologically will be the first one to
get filled. So if this guy came here
first, he's going to get filled first,
then the next one, then the next one,
then the next one, then the next one.
Same here. first this one then this one
then this one and so on and so forth.
This is very easy first in first out
very common
but someone even something even more
common is the first in first out with
lead market maker. So in the book
in the you know market maker side of the
book you will have a market making firm
or multiple market making firms
providing liquidity.
Why do they do that? Well that's a very
profitable business model that I can
explain you pretty quickly. Um
but fundamentally what they do is they
provide
both
bid
and ask at the same time.
So
their business model is to always sell
slightly up and always buy slightly
down. So if they sell 10 contracts at
100 and then buy them back at 99,
they're always earning
this $1 point, right? Which as we
discussed
is the spread.
So, if spread
is what market takers
pay to trade because they're in a FOMO
and they can't wait to get their hands
on a buyer on a seller,
the spread
that they pay is
a hidden fee
that markets makers earn instead.
That's why you see often price going up,
down, up, down, up, down, up, down,
uptick, down tick, uptick, down tick,
uptick, down tick. Every uptick and
every down tick is huge amounts of money
for market makers.
So, they're not just
putting a sell limit here because they
hope price will go down.
Yes, they hope price will go down of a
single tick,
but they're constantly buying, selling,
buying, selling, buying, selling,
buying, selling. And this is a very
profitable business model for them, but
it's also really good for the exchange
because the exchange can guarantee a
constant level of liquidity with really
tight spreads. I mean, this is a
onepoint spread. I'm okay to pay that.
You know,
if there was no market makers here, you
might have a lot of voids in the
liquidity at some point and you're going
to have to pay crazy spreads and traders
are not incentivized to trade there and
to pay commissions to the exchange
because every time you trade, you pay a
commission to the exchange. Who do you
think you pay to? Just your broker? No,
sir.
So it's in the best interest of the
exchange to have market makers because
they can be able to provide tighter
spreads.
So
they will have a privilege and with a
first in first out with lead market
maker type of matching algorithm for
order routing in exchanges
you get all of the volume that comes
inside of a as aggressive orders
split pro rata between
a market maker and then with a normal FO
to all of the rest of the market
participants. So 40% of the volume will
go to them. The 60%
60% will go to these guys. 40% will go
to the market maker who's leading. So
the market making firms 60% will go to
the 5Q.
Okay.
So they get guaranteed 40% of all the
the aggressor liquidity that comes
inside of the market. So it's a good
business model for them. Traders get
guaranteed low spreads and the exchange
earns more money. It's a win-win for
everyone. But
this does not apply
under big impact data release news. So
the only exception for market makers to
not provide liquidity is during big
impact data release
eg NFP CPI FMC because if you think
about it if for example a really good
news come up and markets wants to pump
up there's not going to be uptick down
tick uptick down tick it's going to be
uptick uptick uptick uptick uptick
uptick and as market makers will be
always
here selling
But they will not be able to close off
their position and buy and be neutral to
market direction.
And price will not go one tick up, one
tick down, tic tac, tic tac, tic tac,
and make them earn a lot of money.
They're going to lose, lose, lose, lose,
lose, lose.
Okay?
So that's why they have the ability
whenever they want to delete all of the
liquidity they placed in the book for
just a couple of milliseconds right
after a big news, a very big impact news
has been released.
They can do it. They have this
permission from the exchange and they
still get the lead market maker status.
And this also tells you something
interesting that market makers love
ranging markets. upticks, down ticks,
upticks, down ticks, because that's
where they make money.
They don't What they don't like is price
simply moving up.
Uh market makers don't really like this
because they can't earn a lot of money.
Actually, they're losing
and that's why they always look for
liquidity and the the whole auction
market theory model comes into place.
But we'll get deep into that in the next
few lessons.

Hi and welcome back to micro mechanics
102.
We're going to learn the double
liquidity auction.
So as we've discussed,
these are the paintings being sold at
the auction, right? And we call these
market makers because they make the
market
also known as passive liquidity or
resting orders. These are nothing more
than
orders of you know buy and sell orders
displayed in the order book also known
as market depth. And up here you have
the sell limits.
So, passive sellers,
also known as the offer or the ask,
and these are basically just offering to
be a seller. Okay? They're saying, "Hey,
if you want, I'm selling at this price."
They are the auction of sell orders, the
sell paintings of the auction. And they
wait for someone to accept their sell
offers. Just like when you place a sell
limit. You wait for someone and you wait
for the market to reach your level and
fill you. Right
below here, same thing. You have buy
limits, passive buyers, also known as
the bids,
and they're offering to be a buyer.
Okay? They are the auction of buy
paintings.
And they wait for someone to accept
their buy offer. Okay? So, they are just
waiting.
And we call the closest bid and the
closest ask to the current price the
best bid and the best ask.
So the best ask is the best possible
price
at which there's at least a seller
available in the book. The best bid is
the best possible price where there's at
least a buyer in the book.
And again, these are just resting
orders, okay? There's
offers of liquidity,
just like paintings sold at an auction.
Someone now needs to raise their hand in
the audience and take action and accept
paying a slightly worse price for the
trade to happen. If you want to get your
hands on the Mona Lisa, you're going to
pay a little more if you want it because
other people are ready to pay.
So the bidder comes and say hey I will
buy two contracts market
and he will get filled by being a market
taker. Okay as we define it a aggressive
buyer. So he says I will buy two
contracts market. So those two contracts
that were present here will go all the
way here and get matched with this two
buy contract. So to buy two sell they're
matched. It's a match. And who did the
matching is the matching algorithms,
the CME, the exchange.
Now this is the new price, right?
Because as soon as someone raises the
hands in the audience, that becomes the
new price that someone needs to beat,
right? Exactly the same. Now this is the
new price. The new price is set as soon
as there's a match between a aggressive
participants and a passive one.
And with normal candles, this is where
your candle would open. Right now,
another one comes says, I will buy two
contracts at the best possible price.
Well, those two contracts are matched
with two contracts
from those five that were here at 101.
That's a match. And boom, price sticks
up. And that's because the new price is
wherever there was at least one match
between an aggressor and a resting
order.
Now a seller finally comes and says,
"Hey, I will sell five contracts at the
best buyer."
Well, who's the best buyer here? This
guy. Two contracts at 99. Well, he wants
five. Who's the next best buyer here?
Okay. So, I'm going to buy some here and
some here. Yep.
That is called slippage,
right? Probably heard about it.
So you get this order got slipped and
some of it got filled here and some of
it got filled here. So
the average price of this trade will
actually be somewhere around the middle
because I paid 99 I paid 98. So probably
the average is like 98.5 or something
right?
But the last place, the last price level
where there was a match
was this one, right? So that becomes the
new price and the candle will tick down.
Okay? This is the mechanics behind every
single price movement
that you see inside of charts.
That's it.
Okay.
Now, the best ask and the best bid are
far away from each other, right? They
were here close and now they're far. We
call the difference between bid and ask
the spread.
And in low liquidity environments, so
where there's no liquidity, no
counterpart, no sell or buy orders
counterparting
the aggressors,
spread widens.
So
markets to recap just like in an auction
move because someone is willing to pay a
slightly higher price that we call
spread.
So if you're ready to sp to pay a spread
and buy market or sell market, you're
going to move price even with just one
contract.
So markets, prices in financial markets
move
because someone is willing to pay a
slightly higher or lower price to buy or
sell
as long as they can get their hands on a
counterpart.
Because think about it, you could if you
wanted to buy, you have two options. You
either place a buy offer, so you just
offer to buy
and place a buy limit at a slightly
better price
and hope that an aggressive seller would
accept that offer.
Or you immediately pay a higher price
to guarantee you're going to get filled
now, but you're going to have to accept
a slightly worse price.
Do you understand the difference?
So markets are moved by traders who
cannot afford to wait to get filled.
Kind of in a FOMO, right? I cannot wait
to get filled. I want to be in the
market. Now
these type of participants are the one
who move the market.
Who causes a change in price.
Now, let's imagine, for example, that
Apple has just discovered a new
technology that will 10x their profits
because they're going to make their
iPhones finally make coffee as well.
What will happen to their stock price?
Well, this is the let's pretend this is
the order book of Apple stocks. Well,
first of all, you're going to see less
aggress less passive sellers, right?
Because no one is really willing to sell
so much now.
So that also means that compared to
here, it's going to be way faster for
price to go up because if 10 aggressors
come now, the price will be 102. If 10
aggressors come now, price will likely
be way up. So the amount of liquidity
that's here will determine how fast
price goes up.
And if is and if there is a huge
imbalance between the bids
and the asks it's likely that this you
know direction is the path of least
resistance.
So now everyone buys okay and price
shoots up
and as we know it's a very well
doumented phenomenon happens which is
price pokes through the ceiling of
traders.
So this does not happen because there's
more buyers than sellers. As a lot of
people say the market is long, the
market is buying. No, there's always a
buyer and a seller. They're just matched
at a different price and whoever was the
one accepting the worst price is the one
moving it.
So this does not happen because there's
more buyers than sellers, but because
buyers were willing to pay worse and
worse prices as long as they could get
their hands on a seller, which is a
slight but very important crucial
difference.
