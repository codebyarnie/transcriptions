Hi and welcome back to auction market
theory 101
in this orderflow mastery course
and we will lay down
in this video and the next few ones the
basics of understanding of the liquidity
auction theory model which is the
ultimately realistic
model to analyze market structure based
on facts, based on data, based on
reality that deletes all the fluff,
all the I think all the my opinion is
and most of the stuff that you normally
are fed in social medias.
And we start from this model. Okay.
It's very simple model.
Consolidation,
balance,
fair value,
imbalance,
no fair value.
search for liquidity price discovery
and then again
balance.
Okay,
these are the main phases of the auction
market theory model.
Why does this happen?
Well,
let's imagine that as we know, let's say
we start from here, we have
all of these passive sellers, all of
these passive buyers,
and there's
sellers aggressing
the bid, buyers accepting and lifting
the ask.
And the double auction keeps moving
price up and down, up and down.
And throughout all of this phase of the
market,
all four of our forces,
passive buyers, passive sellers,
aggressive buyers, aggressive sellers,
are in a situation of balance where
you'll typically see from the volume
profile a situation of fair value and a
lot of money being traded
throughout all the range.
And this is a situation where both
forces are agreeing that this is a fair
price to trade. That's what we have to
understand from this because as we know
markets move because
of the variation in the perceived value
of the underlying asset.
So whenever we think that you know both
sellers and buyers aggressive and
passive think
that this range of price is fair. It's a
fair valuation
where it's fair to trade
where it's fair to sell and to buy
both aggressively and passively in a way
that makes price action balanced.
that will keep the price around the same
range because of the trading activity
that happens behind makes us understand
that that's a fair price for the market.
that whenever we
try to
auction in the higher prices,
there's more of a bias to sell.
And whenever we move to the lower ranges
of the range,
there's more of a bias to buy. So a
situation of balance is the ultimate
description
of a fair valuation. That's why we call
this the fair value area.
But something happens. Something might
happen. A news might come out as we
remember the example with Apple.
Well, when Apple releases its earnings
and it's way higher than expected and
they're making a lot of money, well, the
perceived valuation of the Apple stock
will rise. So, if before buyers and
sellers were agreeing that this was a
fair price to trade,
well, sellers might not agree anymore
that this is a fair price to trade.
aggressive buyers instead and you know
all all sorts of buyers will agree that
this is a fair price to buy. This is a
fair price to buy. This one is as well.
This one is as well. And all of these
ones are fair prices to buy
and to aggressively accept paying
slightly higher prices as long as they
can get their hands on the underlying
asset.
And this shift in the auction typically
happens either because you know in the
most stupid example something happened a
news came out
or because the net pressure of long-term
market participants
taking into consideration the
fundamental value.
So this fundamental bias is long
and you know most institutional traders
will typically split their orders right
they will not put their order in the
market all at once but they will
fraction it okay and they will fraction
it in order to not have this impact on
price so that they can get a better fill
right because if they were to buy all of
these orders all at once what will
They will buy some here, buy some here,
buy some here, buy some here, buy some
here, and their average price would be
here for example.
But if they buy just a little bit, wait
till more aggressive sellers come and
then buy a little bit more and then buy
a little bit more where now their fill
is here instead of being up here. So for
an optimal execution of these huge
orders that big banks, hedge funds, and
all of these smart money market
participants
have to go through in order to get a
better feel of these order,
this mass of orders, they will typically
fraction their orders, right? And a lot
of the order flow you're going to see
comes from
this
perfectly cadenced rhythm of fractional
institutional orders, right?
And at some point one of the two flows
might outflow
the opposition. Okay?
So in the you know most stupid example
this happens because of a change in the
fundamental perception
but it also could be a continuation of
the current perception
because maybe they just need to pour
more money in the market to fill all of
their position so the auction just goes
higher. Right? And
if I had to ask you a question, right,
these buyers that are
buying and paying a spread, do they like
paying a spread and constantly get
filled at worse and worse prices, do
they like it? Not really. What would be
the ideal scenario for them? That a huge
seller in the book was here. They would
buy into it. He would absorb all of them
so they can get a good fill because they
think price will go up anyways. So they
get a better fill.
But sellers are not present, not as
much. The book is thinner on the sell
side.
So what they're actually doing when
they're pushing price up because of this
aggression is intrinsically looking for
liquidity,
looking for counterpart,
looking for an easier way to trade that,
you know, they don't get filled at worse
and worse prices.
They're looking for sellers
that consider these prices fair. And
they might not find it for a long time
but at some point they will because
prices will rise. And now also the
sellers
will start seeing this this level of
price as a fair price to trade as a fair
price to sell.
So we will find ourselves again in a
situation of balance where both forces
aggressive buyers aggressive sellers
passive buyers passive sellers agree
that
this is a decent price to trade
and that's why you see a lot of volume
going on. Again a lot of trading
activity. This is where where smart
money prefer to trade because there's a
lot of liquidity. there's not a lot of
price movement. They can get their fill
very optimally.
And that's where the auction clearly
tells us something.
The price action
is explaining as a consequence of volume
that the market from both sides is
accepting that this is the new fair
valuation, that this is the new fair
price. Before this was a fair the the
fair price. Now this is the fair price.
So the auction
is likely to keep bringing price up.
Okay. This is when a trend is qualified.
So not just this
with highs and lows and highs and lows.
We want to see this
market agreeing that that's a fair price
on both sides.
Not for a small price swing for a long
time.
We need proof that all the institutional
order flow is on our side.
And this is the basics of the auction
market theory model. So, you got a
balanced market, a fair value area, an
imbalanced market, and then again a
balanced market.
Let's get deeper.
It's not just going to go like this,
okay? It's likely going to go
like this, right?
And the next level into framing this in
a way that is more realistic is
introducing failed auctions. Okay.
And by failed auction we mean one of the
two parties of the auction
auctioning higher for example.
So an attempt to break
that does not happen
because either
aggressive sellers
take control of the market
or because this phase of aggressive
buying exhausts
and aggressive selling
starts to take control again and bring
brings price back in a situation of fair
value and the auction in a situation of
balance. This is what we call a failed
auction. Could happen on the other side,
right?
All of these buyers are considering
these prices to be fair enough to push
price higher. And if sellers do the same
thing and they try and auction lower,
well, you could expect the same buyers
that bought here, well, now they're
going to consider these prices even
cheaper. So you're going to have some
form of pressure
that will lead prices back up in a
situation of balance.
So this attempt of one party
to search for lower liquidity
that fails
to try a new price discovery phase that
fails, we call failed auction.
And it can come in a bunch of different
fashions. It could either be an
exhaustion from sellers
and buyers taking the upper hand again
or it could be
sellers being absorbed. They try to
actually push but they find a wall of
passive buyers
and then they simply give up and buyers
take the upper hand. So it can either be
a dry up
in sell volume while going down or an
absorption from buyers. Same thing over
here. Either a dry up in buy volume
or buy volume increasing but finding a
wall
that like Gandalf, right? You shall not
pass. And then sellers taking the upper
hand.
Same thing over here, right? We have two
times a failed auction. The sellers try
to auction lower and accept paying lower
lower and lower prices. But the same
buyers that consider this and this is
even more powerful. The same buyers that
consider these prices to be completely
fair actually super cheap
driving the auction higher
causing a situation of imbalance.
Well, those ones now are going to be
very hungry to buy more.
And any attempt to exit the fair value
is
has a higher likelihood of failing than
creating a new auction because you have
this to deal with first.
You have these prices to deal with first
and buyers were considering these super
cheap
in a very recent time.
But at the same time,
sellers might be ready to
keep the buyers in check above here.
Every time buyers try to attempt
auctioning higher, these are prices that
for sellers are considerably cheap or in
this case a really good premium to sell
and they will push price back into
balance. This is what will happen most
of the time. price will attempt a
breakout. There's only one breakout that
works. Only one actually breaks out
because it breaks out.
These ones are attempt to break out that
that simply breaks back in.
And we call these failed auctions.
So you will tend to see
areas of balance, areas of imbalance
that will coincide with areas of fair
valuation from the perspective of
volume. Low volume areas and then high
volume areas again.
Just like this
areas where market agreed on a price,
stay there a bunch of time and traded a
lot of money. areas where not a lot of
volume was traded, not a lot of money
was traded, not a lot of time was spent
there, but the auction was way more
aggressive.
So, still very significant.
These, by the way, are the best, the
absolute best trading setups
because you both get the strength of the
imbalance,
the exit from fair value,
and a situation
where buyers are also
keeping the sellers in check in a
situation of fair value.
and sellers likely considering these
prices a little more fair than these
ones.
So in a situation like this where we'd
like to take a look at price action,
we'll not just draw highs and lows
as a visual reference points because you
know this is Dow theory, right? Market
is high, market is low, market's going
high, market's going low. So higher
higher, higher low, we're in an uptrend.
Good boy. Yeah. Um,
we'll take a look at the market in this
way. Where is the most volume traded?
Where did the price try to auction? And
what happened after?
What was the effort? What was the
result?
This is a much more rational way of
looking at markets because it's based on
facts. It's based on data. It's based on
volume.

Hi and welcome back to the auction
market theory 102.
We're going to discuss now trading
ranges in failed auctions.
So whenever price
approaches
the extremes of our
fair valuation area where statistically
70%
which is a standard deviation
of volume is traded of money is exchange
of trading activity is happening
we get into the anomalies.
Okay, with the same principle we've
decided and decoded before, these are
the areas where we either want to sell
at
as soon as price approaches them when we
see confirmation from order flow
or wait to be
broken and
see an attempt
of an upside auction
failing, which is even better. Okay,
same thing over here.
When this happens
or when this happens,
those are potential high probability
buying opportunities.
So, we want to then take a look at
what happens with orderflow inside of
these areas
to find a confirmation
that passive and aggressive forces are
giving us a asymmetric
opportunity
from a risk-to-reward and win rate
standpoint. So we want a high
probability of going up
and a high risk-to-reward for taking
that trade.
So these are very simple models, very
simple models. We take a daily volume
profile and we look at what happens
here, what happens here.
We wait for a confirmation that price
will drop back inside and we take that
trade to the other side
and vice versa. Now let's make an
example a practical example
by
looking at a situation of
clear fair value
and looking at what happens in the
following session.
Well, we know these are the errors. So
let's remove
the volume profile so we can just see
the price action and the order flow.
The next session starts here. So we
already have a good indication. We
started our session inside of the
previous value area.
Then what happens?
Take a look at orderflow and we read
what might have happened.
Well, the first idea as we said is we're
going to try and see if there's any buy
opportunity here. Right? So we see price
dropping dropping
dropping
and at some point here we see a lot of
volume traded from both sides.
So we have a war here between buyers and
sellers which we consider could consider
some form of absorption and when we try
to auction lower what happens there's a
dry up in volume.
There's some selling but buyers are way
more aggressive.
Well that's a failed auction right here.
We have a big phase of absorption. So we
probably price did something like this.
Tried to push out and was dropped back
inside by aggressive buyers.
So we have a failed auction
and then price pushing high really
aggressively.
A lot of imbalances on the side.
That's when we know
where we have let's say the first
indication
that price is likely to bounce back off
can take volume itself.
So there was a lot of volume in this
candle but no follow through and the
following candle
dropped back inside.
And from here, this is our buy idea
to the other side of the range.
You could either wait for a test
or wait for the following candle
to close
and even maybe take a slightly lower
risk-to-reward.
one to two
and that's a high probability trade. Now
let's go to the other side and see what
happens.
Well,
we have buyers really aggressive on the
upside.
As soon as we're outside, big volume
dropping back inside,
but the candle still does not close back
inside.
more aggressive buying is being absorbed
here.
And as we stay outside of here, volume
dries up. So there's a phase of
exhaustion. There's not a lot of trading
activity here.
And then what happens? Well, we drop
aggressively back inside with even more
volume and a lot of aggression, a lot of
imbalances.
Well, that's the first
indication
that we might continue lower.
So we either wait for a test here
or for example do this and sell in this
one. We likely get stopped out. But we
took a good decision. We took a smart
decision.
The point here is not, you know, making
money all the time. The point here is
looking at what's happening in the
auction and acting accordingly.
And then once again, what happens?
We tried to drop back inside. We saw
there was a lot of aggressive selling
going on, but maybe they were not ready
yet.
So buyers take the upper hand again
while being inside of the range.
They push price outside and as they do,
volume again dries up.
aggressive selling,
pump in volume.
And the last candle
that tells us buyers are not ready
is here
where we see again an exhaustion in
buyers
that tries to push up very quickly. they
go down
and the following candle is just
unrefutable proof
that we're ready to drop back inside.
Look at this.
Super high delta imbalances, super high
volume, drops back inside, tests, and
that's our entry.
And slowly but surely that's what
happens.
So with this very simple framework
we took one trade take profit. We took
another trade stop-loss and took the
last trade take profit
with a very easy framework. Looking at
what buyers are doing, look at what
sellers are doing. Framing the auction
correctly so we have a context of what
we want to do.
And we take the decision based on data.
We take the decision based on what the
money is telling us.

21
Hi and welcome to auction market theory
103 trading breakouts. So, we talked
about
how to behave in a ranging type of
situation,
but let's also identify what happens
when we break out of certain volume
areas. So, we might be in an uptrend
already, and we might want to join the
trend instead of opting for a pingpong
reversal.
So we want to take a look at what
happens here. For example, we want to
take a look at what happens during the
test with orderflow
and framing our entry for a breakout in
a directional session
while at the same time seeing what
happens during the breakout through
orderflow and see if there's a high
chance a high likelihood of a
follow-through in price.
So what we would like to see in a
situation like this
is high volume,
high delta,
and not something that simply dries up,
something that continues to have a high
volume.
And if and when there is an attempt for
sellers to drop back inside of a
comfortable area,
we want to see a dry up in sell volume
and buyers taking the upper hand on the
test as well.
Then we know it's a valid breakout. And
we can take the same example we've had
here.
We have a situation where
price tried to auction higher but
couldn't.
So we finally have a break below with a
lot of candles closing below.
And what can we see if we look at
orderflow?
Can we see during the breakout an
increase in volume that does not stop?
Well, this is the candle that broke out.
Let's look at volume.
Oh, look at that.
Increasingly, increasingly high and then
increasingly high again.
Well, how about on the buy side? Is
there increasing volume? Not so much.
Oh,
that's a very interesting thing. That's
exactly the polar opposite of what
happened here
where we had
at the breakout
by volume drying up and then when we
dropped back inside then volume rising
up again.
This is exactly the opposite.
And it's data. It's undisputable
proof.
It's data based on money.
Well, this candle is not just a fat ass
candle, but a lot of imbalances. Okay,
interesting.
Sellers being absorbed slightly at the
bottom, but then poked through.
Okay, we have all the confirmations that
this is a qualified breakout.
Again,
little fair valuation. again fair
valuation and then auctioning lower and
lower. Also the small time fractal
volume profiles tells us that value is
going lower.
Then we have a retracement. We have an
auction higher.
Okay. Well,
our bias is sell, right?
It's pretty clear. This is the area
we've been following through the whole
time.
Well, what happens here? What happens to
all of these aggressive buyers? Oh,
would you look at that?
Absorbed.
Absorbed. Absorbed. Absorbed. They try
to push up. They can't. And if they try
harder, look at this. Imbalances on the
top.
Aggressive sellers take the upper hand
again.
And boom.
sellers take the upper hand
and what happens during the breakout?
Volume increases again.
One more test and we melt for the entire
session. Okay, here's there's probably a
bug in the in the
data feed,
but all of that session
with a qualified breakout where the
money was telling us, not just a candle,
just looking at this, you're blind.
You're just blind
to what the market is actually able to
tell you. And that's a breakout we that
we can trade very successfully.
either directly on the test because we
saw the volume here. We saw the volume
going up. We saw the aggressions and ab
buyers trying to absorb but failing. So
we know who's in control in the auction.
There's a lot of money in control of the
auction and it's going down.
So whenever there's a pullback that's an
opportunity.
So you either place yourself
in the imbalance itself,
which is a really good trick.
So you basically look at the candle,
take the cluster of imbalances,
and that's your
sell entry zone with a stop above the
candle.
Or if you want to be more conservative,
you wait for a second confirmation
because, you know, you might be scared
of this candle. You might say, "Hey,
there's a lot of aggressive here. Um,
let me see first." Well, totally fine.
So, you wait for a phase of absorption.
Sellers taking the upper hand again.
Buyers trying to stop them failing.
Okay, now it's the time. Stop above
here. Let's [ __ ] roll.
And that's
how you manage a breakout.

Hi and welcome to orderflow dynamics
101. We're going to take a look at how
we can identify the auctions fractally
inside of the footprints. So auction
footprints
we mainly divide the auctions in the
footprint in initiative and responsive.
Initiative being the same as a situation
of imbalance.
Responsive similarly to what happens in
a situation of balance.
So what you would typically see during
an initiative candle. So this is an
initiative candle. These are both
initiative candles. a sell initiative
candle and a buy initiative candle is
you will see high volume
high delta percentage because you want
to see mostly aggressive buying or
mostly aggressive selling going on
inside of the candle and leading the
auction higher or lower.
You'll tend to want to see many
imbalances
widespread volume distribution. So, not
just one big
uh volume distribution, but you want to
see it's widespread throughout the whole
candle just like this.
And you want, of course, a full candle.
So, by high volume, you want to compare
it, of course, to the previous candles.
So, you look at the previous candles,
see if this one has more volume. with
high delta percentage. You want to at
least have more than 10% delta. There
was a mistake here. Probably this was
not percentage. Uh but probably this
would have been
2.2
divided by five.
That's around a quarter. So 25%
deltaish,
something less, maybe 20%. Well, that's
a big delta. Whatever is above 10%
is a decently good delta. So that's how
we want to spot even in the lower time
frame
an initiative auction.
So let's take here for example. Let's uh
take a situation where we have a
situation of ranging and then a
breakout. Well, this one is clearly one.
We have a situation of balance, right?
And when we break out, what happens?
Let's look at the candles
and the order flow. Well, we see a lot
of imbalance here, but we're still in
the range, right? Let's first take a
look at what's the actual range.
This is more or less the big range,
right?
And then we break out around here. So,
let's take a look at what happens during
the actual breakout.
Oh, there you go.
Look at this. So, we have first, of
course, a buyer trying to absorb that
gets completely
ran through.
And this candle tells us everything we
need. We have a lot of imbalances. One,
two, three, four, five, six imbalances.
We have an increase in volume activity.
We have a really high delta, 37%.
That's an initiative auction. The
following great sell candle, what does
it have?
Lot of contracts, a lot of delta, maybe
7%, but still a lot of imbalances in the
candles.
That's what we want to see and what we
tend to see during breakouts.
Even here below this low, we break down.
What happens?
Well, in the breakout, volume increases
from 2.7 to 3.8 eight
again prices break from a low volume
increases
and these are all initiative candles
minus 11%
delta
and so on and so forth. So these are
initiative auctions,
high volume, high delta, many
imbalances, big candles.
A responsive auction, which is kind of
the opposite, will tend to look
something like this. You will tend to
see during the ranging phase in the
upper ends
buyers being absorbed. So you'll see a
lot of greens at the tops. Greens at the
top, green at the top, greens at the
top.
Especially if you're in this situation
and you expect this and right after big
imbalances and initiation coming as soon
as we break through.
So you want to see typically some phases
of absorption at the top and typically
if for example you're expecting an
uptrend you want to see also some at the
bottoms.
Okay you want to see sellers being
absorbed at the bottom which didn't
happen in this specific example.
In this one though yes
we had aggression here. We had these
imbalances and as soon as we get too low
we start absorbing them. Purple on the
bottom. purple on the bottom and then
aggressive buyers taking the upper hand
responsiveness. So we have a response
from passive buyers.
Okay.
So let's zoom in. Let's see what
happened here. And you can clearly see
after a big directional phase,
we have a situation of responsiveness.
We have buyers absorbing all throughout
the lows of the candles. You see the
dark areas at the bottoms of the
candles, right? This is clear
responsiveness.
This means that all of the passive
buyers in these
flashes of price are responding, are
buying, are blocking the way. But then
you look at the tops, you see a lot of
green at the top, a lot of green at the
top, a lot of green at the top. Well,
also buyers are doing their thing. So
this is our range.
And as soon as we break out, we want to
see some initiative. 23% 1.4K
increase in volume.
And what you would tend to see during
these phases is
delta tending to be flatter.
Not a lot of high delta. You don't want
to see a lot of high delta in these
situations. It's likely less. Okay?
Likely a little bit less.
And this is what you'll typically see.
in a situation of responsive auction.

23
Hi and welcome back to orderflow
mastery. This is orderflow dynamics 102
absor absorption versus exhaustion. And
these are two let's say reversal type of
patterns that are
anticipating in a way the same thing
which is a reversal in price but are
fundamentally different
and we're going to see some example now.
So we define an absorption
as a lot of activity in this case buying
that does not have a clear result in
price. So you see this big ass volume
areas a lot of color a lot of imbalance
that's called an absorption. a lot of
money, a lot of volume clogged in a
single tick or in maybe two or three
ticks.
Same thing happened over here to sellers
by the way when they tried to push down.
Sellers here were absorbed. A thousand
of them was absorbed here, but then they
had a follow-through, right?
But these are called areas of
absorption. An exhaustion phase instead
is a phase where you'll typically see
from a profile standpoint a dry up in
volume. You see how there's less and
less volume
and especially in the last few steps
there's less and less and less and less
volume.
So you don't have a clear phase of
absorption here.
You had an attempt,
a dry up and sell volume and buyers
taking the upper hand right away. Not by
absorbing
but with an exhaustion from sellers. So
sellers stopped accepting lower prices
at the same pace as buyers. Aggressive
buyers.
That's an exhaustion. That's the
difference between a phase of absorption
where you have
the passive participants blocking price.
Let's see if we can
get back to this one. So here you have
passive participants, passive sellers
blocking price from going up and then
taking the upper hand. That's
absorption.
When this happens
in a way that
it is aggressive selling that dries up
without a clear wall from aggressive
from passive buyers and then buyers
taking the upper hand. That's what we
define as an exhaustion.
Slight difference but very important to
understand the language of orderflow.

24
This is
two at the same time. This is a very
common rejection pattern where
you will see a high ratio orderflow
exhaustion. So the first thing you will
see is on the sell side. So where we're
coming from, what you want to see as a
form of of exhaustion,
you want to see this number and this
number having a higher ratio than 10 to
one.
In this case, we have it.
This is a high ratio orderful
exhaustion. So there's an exhaustion in
selling activity.
And paired with this
you want to see an imbalance reversal.
So
on the very last auction so with a zero
here
the first number here having an
imbalance of at least 400%.
Or 300%. You know that these are just
numbers but you want to see a big
imbalance.
This is a clear sign of rejection
of both dry up in sell activity
and huge strength from buyers.
So you have a high ratio orderful
exhaustion and an imbalance reversals,
an imbalance on bottom.
Same thing, by the way, happens the
other way around.
So you want to have a high ratio
orderful exhaustion on the upside. So
all of these aggressive buyers from 200
to 7. So it has at least a 10 to1 ratio.
And you want to see an imbalance on top.
Okay. I forgot to write this. This
should be imbalance
rejection.
Okay. Same thing. So we have both buyers
not willing to accept higher prices
anymore. dry up in buying volume and
aggressive sellers taking the upper
hand. When you see this at the top of a
candle, it's a very good sign. It's a
really, really good sign that will
reject

Now let's take an another look at
another very important pattern. And just
as much as the stomp run is an anomaly
also big orders are typically an
anomaly. We want to capitalize on
orderflow anomalies that can reliably
make us money. So big orders and iceberg
iceberg walls are definitely one of
them. Big orders are much more common
than iceberg walks. Iceberg walls are
way more rare. They used to be much more
common in the markets,
but they're worth mentioning because
sometimes they'll happen in low
liquidity environments and that's a
feast.
So, the first thing we want to see when
we see absorptions in big orders is, for
example, in a one minute candle in the
ES, we want to see at least 1,000
contracts. Okay, that's our minimum
threshold.
We want to see a lot of green
or a lot of purple based on the delta.
And
in these situations, if there's a huge
order in the wick of the candle and
price rejects from it, we know that
big market participant is dominating the
market.
If price were to do that and then break,
we know there's something even bigger
that's going to push price up. So
whenever we have
a huge trade above 1.2K contracts in an
ES tick one minute candle and a
rejection that's a good indication that
we could continue to go lower. If we
have a closure of the candle above this
then we could keep going up.
And here is a very clear example of the
same thing.
We closed the candle below and we
started auctioning lower. And for that
session, spoiler alert, we went down the
whole freaking session.
Same thing over here. So, we we want to
see we want to take a look at the
footprint. We see that there's an
anomaly here, right? We have 1.2,000
contracts in a single tick. That's a big
order. That's either a big order in the
book or an iceberg. You can you can
discriminize if it's an iceberg or just
a big trade by looking at the depth of
market. And in the depth of market, what
you will see here is a big order right
in the in the dome in the aggressive the
passive buyers. That's how you know it's
just a big order. Otherwise,
you will not see it at all. And then you
know it's an iceberg, which means it's a
small order that's simply reloaded a
bunch of times.
And as you can see here, we don't candle
close below this. We don't manage to
close. The following candle is an upward
candle
and we push up.
Here we have another example shortly
shortly after
of a passive buyer trying to block
the upward auction of sellers completely
ran through. No candle close and we keep
auctioning higher. So you take these
reference points of big trades
and you see what does price do after.
Well, that's a good indication of where
price will likely keep going.
But sometimes you might see situations
like this. You're not going to find a
lot of them, guys. But if you find them,
well, if I find them, I will I will take
advantage of them. It's not financial
advice.
But you can clearly see here that
sellers are trying to go down and
there's a big buyer here. 260. And what
happens? Bounce.
We drop back down.
Bounce. Drop back into it. Bounce. Drop
back into it again. Bounce. This is an
edge you can capitalize on.
This is called an iceberg wall. Okay.
They're literally punching to the wall.
punching to the wall and nothing moves.
So, this is a very big order, very big
order
that we can front and buy from.
Earn a couple ticks, wait for it to come
again. So take profit,
buy again, take profit, buy again, take
profit, buy again, take profit a couple
times and then 90% of the time it will
be ran through and we could opt for a
breakout trade.
They will do something called momentum
ignition. Ignition. You will see a bunch
of market order being shot into the
market all at once. Sort of like a stop
run. And that's potentially a good entry
for a sell.
And that's how we trade big orders and
iceberg walls.
Here you have another example where
there was a big order here, caused a
bounce, and then price just ran through
it like it was nothing.
Momentum ignition, a lot of imbalances,
market orders. That's a good sell setup.
This is all scalping dynamics, by the
way.
And we dropped down for the rest of the
entire session. But we had a big fight.
Who won the big fight? Aggressive
sellers. Well, that's where I'm joining
the party. I want to stay with the
winners. And I can clearly see thanks to
Orderflow, unlike with any other price
action chart,
what the big money, the smart money is
doing.
This is another example where we have a
big trade over here. Candle closes
below. We test it. We don't manage to
have any auction above here and we keep
dropping for the entire session.
This is another example where we had
a very aggressive auction, a lot of
imbalance, a lot of green going on and
then you had
absorption here, absorption here,
absorption here. These are all big
orders
and they form this sort of liquidity
pocket. this area where there's a lot of
trading going on. Absorption on both
sides of the auction.
And in this type of situation, you see
it's the same exactly the same level.
This is disturbingly accurate. But at
the end of the day, what happens? We
auction higher. Well, now we know where
to go. Now we have a clear direction. We
have a clear understanding of which one
of these big fishes have won because
it's not retails. It's not phytolantons.
These are whales putting billions in the
market every single minute of every
single day. And we have undisputable
proof of who has won that battle and we
want to be on the right side of that
battle.
Another
example here.
Big order, big absorption.
Is there any candle at all that closes
above here? No. What happens right after
sell initiative imbalances? Okay. You
know what? Guess what I'm going to do
when price comes and test it?
One way out.
Pure objectivity. Pure raw data.

Hi and welcome to Orderflow Dynamics 104
in this orderflow mastery course. In
this video, we'll take a look at stop
prints. And stop prints are a very
interesting pattern in orderflow that
does not happen very often as much as
people think. Okay?
And they are much more insignificant
that a lot of people think because a lot
of people think that there's this
stop-loss hunting for retail traders,
but you know, retail traders make up
probably less than 5% of the volume.
Depends on the market, but they're not
hunting for your stupid stop-loss.
Okay, that's that's just that's just a
fact. Uh but sometimes stops might get
triggered and they may cause some price
movement. Okay, I'm just saying that
they're not hunting for them. Okay, no
one is hunting for you. No one's after
you. Okay, market don't give a [ __ ]
about you.
But above high and below lows, of
course, there's stop orders, right?
Because people place their stops above
there or their market orders for
continuations, for example, sell stops
below there. That's that's absolutely an
observable phenomenon.
So, you will see stopps, you will see
moments where stop orders enter the
market and move price. So let's say for
example you have
a high or multiple highs at the same
time and you would expect here to have
stop orders
and stop orders
as we've discussed
are market orders. So they are
aggressive buyers because if price is
here, right? Let's say price is here.
Okay, let's uh let's change the color.
Let's say prices here. What will you
have? You will have
passive buyers
and you will have passive sellers,
right?
So a buy stop
that could be above there
is placed above the current price.
Right? This is the current price. So
it's a pending order that does not stay
in the book because in the book you have
buy limits below the price and sell
limits above the price. Above the price
you have sellers in the book. So you
will not see buy stops in the book.
Buy stops will be placed there and
executed market and take
the best bid or the best ask.
Okay.
So let's say now price
moves here and we approach this level
and there's a lot of buy stops here,
right? Let's say this is buy stop, buy,
stop, buy, stop ready to enter the
market. You have
passive buyers here
and then you have
passive sellers here.
Well, all of these market buy orders.
They will enter market just like their
market orders just by market. So, they
go a little bit here, a little bit here,
a little bit here, and they'll enter all
at once in a very fast way, in a very
fast-paced way because they happen all
at the same time. They're all triggered
at the same time. and they will eat all
of the liquidity in the book.
They will eat all of these sellers, all
these passive sellers, causing a very
fast price move up that likely will get
reabsorbed because that's the path of
this resistance because imagine
all of these get bought. So these get
bought, these get bought, these get
bought, they're executed. So a lot of
aggressive buying coming in.
And let's say this is now price.
It's going to take some time for buyers
to repopulate these levels with new
passive orders.
You're going to still have a lot of
aggressive sorry passive sellers above
here.
So now the path of least resistance
is this one because in this situation
you'll typically not have a lot of
orders here because all of these
aggressive buyers have swept the book.
That's why we call it book sweeping. Not
because the stops are being swept but
because the limit sell orders have been
swept by market aggressors in the form
of stop orders.
So, this will be an empty space in the
book
that will likely get filled right away.
And then you see
this happening. And a lot of traders
will say, "Ha, they hunted for my stop
loss because they actually wanted to go
down." Yeah, that's not how it works,
bro. That's not how it [ __ ] works.
There's orders that have triggered a
fast price movement. That's why we call
it a run because it's fast. It's very
fast and it will go down not because
there was a secret plan from the banks
to [ __ ] you up, but because there's way
less liquidity here and the path of
least resistance is that one. Okay,
that's all there is. No conspiracy
theory, pure order flow. So, what you
would typically see in the first stages
is all of these market orders entering
the market, right? So this is an example
of a stop run and you'll see a lot of
green in the candle. A lot of green
and 0 0 0.
Why did that does that happen? Because
all of these market order that maybe
were above here are entering market all
at once. So they're going to sweep all
the book and sellers will not even have
the time to auction.
Market makers are losing money here.
Okay, for a very short period of time.
And so you will have a big ass
pump up that
70 if not 90% of the time will reverse
will reverse at least back
to the book void
to the path of least resistance.
That's a trade that I, you know, that's
a type of of of trade of setup that I've
shared also on my YouTube channel went
very popular um one of the last videos
where I basically sell above here and
basically opt for a reabsorption of
price.
This is another example. We have a stop
advanced indicator that basically you
can set for the launder session. This is
a low liquidity pattern by the way. This
is very low liquidity pattern. It only
works in low liquidity environments.
So, for example, what you want to see is
high volume, high delta. So, from
278 contracts to 4,000,
mostly delta. Typically, you want to see
it above 20%.
Because it's mostly buy orders, buy
aggressors.
Same thing over here. We have a very
high delta. We get some stop,
you know, resting above here that swept
the book. A lot of green in the candle,
high volume, high delta, imbalances,
big volume, then the rest.
We sell, we take the reabsorption,
and that's it.
